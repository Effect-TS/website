To demonstrate the functionality of different schedules, we will be working with the following helper:

```twoslash include Delay
import { Effect, Schedule, TestClock, Fiber, TestContext } from "effect"

let start = 0
let i = 0

export const log = <A, Out>(
  action: Effect.Effect<A>,
  schedule: Schedule.Schedule<Out, void>
) => {
  Effect.gen(function* () {
    const fiber = yield* Effect.gen(function* () {
      yield* action
      const now = yield* TestClock.currentTimeMillis
      console.log(
        i === 0
          ? `delay: ${now - start}`
          : i === 10
            ? "..."
            : `#${i} delay: ${now - start}`
      )
      i++
      start = now
    }).pipe(
      Effect.repeat(schedule.pipe(Schedule.intersect(Schedule.recurs(10)))),
      Effect.fork
    )
    yield* TestClock.adjust(Infinity)
    yield* Fiber.join(fiber)
  }).pipe(Effect.provide(TestContext.TestContext), Effect.runPromise)
}
```

```ts
declare const log: <A, Out>(
  action: Effect.Effect<A>,
  schedule: Schedule.Schedule<Out, void>
) => void
```

The `log` helper logs the time delay between each execution. We will use this helper to showcase the behavior of various built-in schedules.

<Warning>
The `log` helper accelerates time using [TestClock](../testing/testclock), which means it simulates the passing of time that would normally occur in a real-world application.

## forever

A schedule that always recurs and produces number of recurrence at each run.

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Delay.ts
// @include: Delay

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Schedule, Effect } from "effect"
import { log } from "./Delay"

const schedule = Schedule.forever
const action = Effect.void
log(action, schedule)
/*
Output:
delay: 0
#1 delay: 0 < forever
#2 delay: 0
#3 delay: 0
#4 delay: 0
#5 delay: 0
#6 delay: 0
#7 delay: 0
#8 delay: 0
#9 delay: 0
...
*/
```

## once

A schedule that recurs one time.

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Delay.ts
// @include: Delay

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Schedule, Effect } from "effect"
import { log } from "./Delay"

const schedule = Schedule.once
const action = Effect.void
log(action, schedule)
/*
Output:
delay: 0
#1 delay: 0 < once
*/
```

## recurs

A schedule that only recurs the specified number of times.

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Delay.ts
// @include: Delay

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Schedule, Effect } from "effect"
import { log } from "./Delay"

const schedule = Schedule.recurs(5)
const action = Effect.void
log(action, schedule)
/*
Output:
delay: 0
#1 delay: 0 < recurs
#2 delay: 0
#3 delay: 0
#4 delay: 0
#5 delay: 0
*/
```

## Recurring at specific intervals

In the context of scheduling, two commonly used schedules are `spaced` and `fixed`. While they both involve recurring at specific intervals, they have a fundamental difference in how they determine the timing of repetitions.

The `spaced` schedule creates a recurring pattern where each repetition is spaced apart by a specified duration. This means that there is a delay between the completion of one repetition and the start of the next. The duration between repetitions remains constant, providing a consistent spacing pattern.

On the other hand, the `fixed` schedule recurs on a fixed interval, regardless of the duration of the actions or the completion time of previous repetitions. It operates independently of the execution time, ensuring a regular recurrence at the specified interval.

### spaced

A schedule that recurs continuously, each repetition spaced the specified duration from the last run.

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Delay.ts
// @include: Delay

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Schedule, Effect } from "effect"
import { log } from "./Delay"

const schedule = Schedule.spaced("200 millis")
const action = Effect.delay(Effect.void, "100 millis")
log(action, schedule)
/*
Output:
delay: 100
#1 delay: 300 < spaced
#2 delay: 300
#3 delay: 300
#4 delay: 300
#5 delay: 300
#6 delay: 300
#7 delay: 300
#8 delay: 300
#9 delay: 300
...
*/
```

The first delay is approximately 100 milliseconds, as the initial execution is not affected by the schedule. Subsequent delays are approximately 200 milliseconds apart, demonstrating the effect of the `spaced` schedule.

### fixed

A schedule that recurs on a fixed interval. Returns the number of repetitions of the schedule so far.

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Delay.ts
// @include: Delay

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Schedule, Effect } from "effect"
import { log } from "./Delay"

const schedule = Schedule.fixed("200 millis")
const action = Effect.delay(Effect.void, "100 millis")
log(action, schedule)
/*
Output:
delay: 100
#1 delay: 300 < fixed
#2 delay: 200
#3 delay: 200
#4 delay: 200
#5 delay: 200
#6 delay: 200
#7 delay: 200
#8 delay: 200
#9 delay: 200
...
*/
```

The first delay is approximately 100 milliseconds, as the initial execution is not affected by the schedule. Subsequent delays are consistently around 200 milliseconds apart, demonstrating the effect of the `fixed` schedule.

## exponential

A schedule that recurs using exponential backoff

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Delay.ts
// @include: Delay

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Schedule, Effect } from "effect"
import { log } from "./Delay"

const schedule = Schedule.exponential("10 millis")
const action = Effect.void
log(action, schedule)
/*
Output:
delay: 0
#1 delay: 10 < exponential
#2 delay: 20
#3 delay: 40
#4 delay: 80
#5 delay: 160
#6 delay: 320
#7 delay: 640
#8 delay: 1280
#9 delay: 2560
...
*/
```

## fibonacci

A schedule that always recurs, increasing delays by summing the preceding two delays (similar to the fibonacci sequence). Returns the current duration between recurrences.

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Delay.ts
// @include: Delay

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Schedule, Effect } from "effect"
import { log } from "./Delay"

const schedule = Schedule.fibonacci("10 millis")
const action = Effect.void
log(action, schedule)
/*
Output:
delay: 0
#1 delay: 10 < fibonacci
#2 delay: 10
#3 delay: 20
#4 delay: 30
#5 delay: 50
#6 delay: 80
#7 delay: 130
#8 delay: 210
#9 delay: 340
...
*/
```
