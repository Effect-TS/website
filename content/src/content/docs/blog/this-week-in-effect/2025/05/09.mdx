Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below youâ€™ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

Recent major updates:

- New [Effect Days 2025 talks](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDf3uQLaK2B9bEBZbwMv04e_zSbRNPKH6) every week on YouTube! 
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 4180+ members!

This week, we published Elliot Dauber's **Building LLM Systems with Effect at Markprompt** talk, where he shares how they use Effect to build a type-safe, composable agent framework for complex customer support use cases at [Markprompt](https://www.markprompt.com/). Elliot introduces the concepts of actions, subagents, and workflows, showing how to combine deterministic and non-deterministic behaviors in LLM-powered applications.
