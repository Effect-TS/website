Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers build complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)


**Recent major updates:**

- [Effect 3.19](https://effect.website/blog/releases/effect/319) Release.
- [Effect AI SDK](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/releases/tag/%40effect%2Fai%400.27.0) Release.
- Durable workflows in TypeScript with [`@effect/workflow`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/workflow/README.md) - currently in alpha.
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 5920+ members!

## Happy New Year from the Effect Team

Happy New Year! As we step into 2026, we wanted to take a moment to reflect on what an incredible year 2025 was for Effect.

We gathered in person at Effect Days in Italy and the community hosted meetups across Europe and the US—from Paris and Berlin to NYC and San Francisco. Major releases landed throughout the year, including the Effect AI SDK, Effect LSP, and early access to `@effect/workflow`. The team grew with Mattia Manzati and Kit Langton joining us, and new learning resources like Visual Effect and Effect Solutions launched to help developers master the library.

Adoption continued to grow across production environments at companies like OpenRouter, Warp, Polar, Salesforce DevTools, Vercel Domains, and even within the X (Twitter) codebase. We shared insights through Cause & Effect podcast episodes and live coding sessions, and the year closed with a wonderful Christmas gift from terminal.shop for the community.

For a deeper dive into everything that happened in 2025, check out our [year-in-review blog post](https://effect.website/blog/effect-2025-year-in-review/).

Thank you for making 2025 unforgettable. Here's to building even more in 2026.
