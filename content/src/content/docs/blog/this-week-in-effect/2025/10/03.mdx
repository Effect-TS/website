Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below youâ€™ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

This podcast highlights stories from software engineers and companies using Effect in production. Each episode explores their journey of adopting Effect, including the learning process, challenges faced, and benefits of integrating Effect into their tech stack.

We've published our fifth episode with Samuel Briole, CTO of [Spiko](https://www.spiko.io/), a Paris-based FinTech startup building infrastructure for issuing regulated financial products on public blockchains, specifically risk-free products. 

Spiko utilizes Effect extensively, from day one, for both backend and frontend development, particularly for managing asynchronous operations, API integrations, and smart contracts.
