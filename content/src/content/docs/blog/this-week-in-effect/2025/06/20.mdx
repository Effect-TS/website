Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you‚Äôll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

## Effect Days 2025 Updates

This week, we published the talks by Dmytro Maretskyi and Tim Suchanek.

Dmytro Maretskyi walked us through how [DXOS](https://dxos.org) built Composer, an app platform with real-time collaboration and automated AI workflows.  

- Effect Schema to define structured, typed data shared between users and AI agents.
- Leverage Effect for orchestrating complex asynchronous pipelines and function execution.
- Build a visual orchestration system (Conductor) where every node is an Effect.

Tim Suchanek shared what it‚Äôs like to build distributed, type-safe systems using Effect, and the unexpected powers it unlocked along the way. He walks through real examples from Expand, where Effect powers everything from browser agents to AI pipelines. It‚Äôs a behind-the-scenes tour of how Effect helps build reliable systems, fast.

- The ‚Äúmagic spells‚Äù of Effect: acquireRelease, forkScoped, uninterruptible, and more
- Auto-generating AI evals for quality control
- Resilience patterns with model fallbacks and retries
