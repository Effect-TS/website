Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below youâ€™ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)


**Recent major updates:**

- [Effect 3.17](https://effect.website/blog/releases/effect/317) Release.
- Durable workflows in TypeScript with [`@effect/workflow`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/workflow/README.md) - currently in alpha.
- Effect AI integration packages, [`@effect/ai`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/tree/main/packages/ai) - currently in alpha.
- Effect crossed [10K Stars on GitHub](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect) ðŸŒŸ.
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 5000+ members!

&nbsp;
## Technology
- The `effect-rx` package has been renamed to `effect-atom`. It can now be installed from `npm` using `@effect-atom/atom-react`. To help with migration, [`AtomRpc`](https://github.com/tim-smart/effect-atom?tab=readme-ov-file#effectrpc-integration) module has been added, which integrates `@effect/rpc` with `effect-atom`.

- In v4, Schema is the foundation for validation and decoding, with improved integration across modules.
