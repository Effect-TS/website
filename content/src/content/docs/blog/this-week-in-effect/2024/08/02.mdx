Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) – a weekly update to keep you in the loop with all the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Recent major updates:

- Effect is API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- [Effect 3.6](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.6) has been released.
- Our [community on Discord](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) reached 3310+ members!
- All talks from Effect Days 2024 are available on the [Effect YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts).

## Technology

- This week we introduced the [Effect Playground](https://effect.website/play), an interactive coding experience on Effect’s website for exploring API, with features like Monaco editor, file tree, terminal, and integration with Effect Developer Tools.
