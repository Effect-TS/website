Hi Effecters! 

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) – your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

Get started with Effect with our quick-start guide and documentation below:

- [Effect quick-start guide](/docs/quickstart)
- [Effect docs](/docs/introduction)

Recent major updates:

- Effect is API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- [Effect 3.7](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.7) has been released.
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 3470+ members!

## Community highlights

In the last week, we welcomed 40+ new Effecters to our [Discord community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) - we're very excited to have you all on board! 

+ Alessandro Maclaine has been writing a series of articles about Effect, and recently he wrote about [option sequencing](https://dev.to/almaclaine/understanding-option-sequencing-in-effect-ts-22g7) and [zipping options](https://dev.to/almaclaine/zipping-options-in-effect-ts-a-practical-guide-72h).

+ Johannes Schickling shared how impactful Effect has been in developing his Overtone app. He's using Effect to seamlessly integrate app-specific metrics with Open Telemetry, allowing real-time monitoring of Spotify API interactions in Grafana with just one line of code.
