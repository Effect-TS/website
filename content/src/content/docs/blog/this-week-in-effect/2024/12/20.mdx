Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Recent major updates:

- Effect is API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- [Effect 3.11](https://effect.website/blog/releases/effect/311/) has been released.
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 3740+ members!

## Community highlights

- Laure Retru-Chavastel, Full Stack Software Engineer at Inato, gave an introduction to Effect at an online event hosted by Frontend Queens, "Introduction to Effect - Next Generation TypeScript". In this session, Laure covered some of the key features of the Effect library, such as error handling, data validation, and concurrency. The presentation will be available on YouTube in the next few days.

- Tyson Chen shared two of his personal projects with the community: `effect-builder` and `effect-line`. [`effect-builder`](https://github.com/slashlifeai/effect-builder) is a type-safe, immutable builder to construct complex objects with runtime validation while maintaining compile-time type safety. [`effect-line`](https://github.com/slashlifeai/effect-line) is a collection of Effect-based libraries for working with LINE Platform APIs.

- Dillon Mulroy livestreamed three episodes of his series **Integrating Stripe with Svelte 5 and EffectTS 🚀** on his Twitch channel.
