Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you‚Äôll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

Recent major updates:

- The [Effect Days](https://effect.website/events/effect-days) conference is returning this March 2025! üéâ
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 3870+ members!
