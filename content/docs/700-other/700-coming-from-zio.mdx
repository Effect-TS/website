If you are coming to Effect from ZIO, there are a few differences to be aware of.

## Environment

In Effect, we represent the environment required to run an `Effect` workflow as a union of services:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

//                           v---------v---- `R` is a union of Console | Logger
type Http = Effect.Effect<Console | Logger, IOError | HttpError, Response>

type Response = Record<string, string>

interface IOError {
  readonly _tag: "IOError"
}

interface HttpError {
  readonly _tag: "HttpError"
}

interface Console {
  readonly log: (msg: string) => void
}

interface Logger {
  readonly log: (msg: string) => void
}
```

This may be confusing to folks coming from ZIO, where the environment is represented as an intersection of services:

```scala
type Http = ZIO[Console with Logger, IOError, Response]
```

## Rationale

The rationale for using a union to represent the environment required by an `Effect` workflow boils down to our desire to remove `Has` as a wrapper for services in the environment (similar to what was achieved in ZIO 2.0).

To be able to remove `Has` from Effect, we had to think a bit more structurally given that TypeScript is a structural type system. In TypeScript, if you have a type `A & B` where there is a structural conflict between `A` and `B`, the type `A & B` will reduce to `never`.

```ts twoslash
// @errors: 2322
export interface A {
  readonly prop: string
}

export interface B {
  readonly prop: number
}

const ab: A & B = {
  prop: ""
}
```

In previous versions of Effect, intersections were used for representing an environment with multiple services. The problem with using intersections (i.e. `A & B`) is that there could be multiple services in the environment that have functions and properties named in the same way. To remedy this, we wrapped services in the `Has` type (similar to ZIO 1.0), so you would have `Has<A> & Has<B>` in your environment.

In ZIO 2.0, the _contravariant_ `R` type parameter of the `ZIO` type (representing the environment) became fully phantom, thus allowing for removal of the `Has` type. This significantly improved the clarity of type signatures as well as removing another "stumbling block" for new users.

To faciliate removal of `Has` in Effect, we had to consider how types in the environment compose. By the rule of composition, contravariant parameters composed as an intersection (i.e. with `&`) are equivalent to covariant parameters composed together as a union (i.e. with `|`) for purposes of assignability. Based upon this fact, we decided to diverge from ZIO and make the `R` type parameter _covariant_ given `A | B` does not reduce to `never` if `A` and `B` have conflicts.

From our example above:

```ts twoslash
export interface A {
  readonly prop: string
}

export interface B {
  readonly prop: number
}

const ab: A | B = {
  prop: ""
}
```

Representing `R` as a covariant type parameter containing the union of services required by an `Effect` workflow allowed us to remove the requirement for `Has`.

## Type Aliases

In Effect, there are no predefined type aliases such as `UIO`, `URIO`, `RIO`, `Task`, or `IO` like in ZIO.

The reason for this is that type aliases are lost as soon as you compose them, which renders them somewhat useless unless you maintain **multiple** signatures for **every** function. In Effect, we have chosen not to go down this path. Instead, we utilize the `never` type to indicate unused types.

It's worth mentioning that the perception of type aliases being quicker to understand is often just an illusion. In Effect, the explicit notation `Effect<never, never, A>` clearly communicates that only type `A` is being used. On the other hand, when using a type alias like `RIO<R, A>`, questions arise about the type `E`. Is it `unknown`? `never`? Remembering such details becomes challenging.
