This section covers concurrent operations that allow multiple sinks to run simultaneously. These can be valuable for enhancing task performance when concurrent execution is desired.

## Combining Results with Concurrent Zipping

To run two sinks concurrently and combine their results, use `Sink.zip`. This operation executes both sinks concurrently and combines their outcomes into a tuple.

**Example** (Running Two Sinks Concurrently and Combining Results)

```ts twoslash
import { Sink, Console, Stream, Schedule, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.make("1", "2", "3", "4", "5").pipe(
  Stream.schedule(Schedule.spaced("10 millis"))
)

const sink1 = Sink.forEach((s: string) =>
  Console.log(`sink 1: ${s}`)
).pipe(Sink.as(1))

const sink2 = Sink.forEach((s: string) =>
  Console.log(`sink 2: ${s}`)
).pipe(Sink.as(2))

// Combine the two sinks to run concurrently and collect results in a tuple
const sink = Sink.zip(sink1, sink2, { concurrent: true })

Effect.runPromise(Stream.run(stream, sink)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
sink 1: 1
sink 2: 1
sink 1: 2
sink 2: 2
sink 1: 3
sink 2: 3
sink 1: 4
sink 2: 4
sink 1: 5
sink 2: 5
[ 1, 2 ]
*/
```

## Racing Sinks: First Completion Wins

The `Sink.race` operation allows multiple sinks to compete for completion. The first sink to finish provides the result.

**Example** (Racing Two Sinks to Capture the First Result)

```ts twoslash
import { Sink, Console, Stream, Schedule, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.make("1", "2", "3", "4", "5").pipe(
  Stream.schedule(Schedule.spaced("10 millis"))
)

const sink1 = Sink.forEach((s: string) =>
  Console.log(`sink 1: ${s}`)
).pipe(Sink.as(1))

const sink2 = Sink.forEach((s: string) =>
  Console.log(`sink 2: ${s}`)
).pipe(Sink.as(2))

// Race the two sinks, the result will be from the first to complete
const sink = Sink.race(sink1, sink2)

Effect.runPromise(Stream.run(stream, sink)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
sink 1: 1
sink 2: 1
sink 1: 2
sink 2: 2
sink 1: 3
sink 2: 3
sink 1: 4
sink 2: 4
sink 1: 5
sink 2: 5
1
*/
```
