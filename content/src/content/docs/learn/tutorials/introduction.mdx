## Who this is for

This tutorial assumes you are:

- New to Effect
- Not new to TypeScript / web development
- Want to use Effect in a new or existing project

If you're new to TypeScript you may still be able to follow along, but we aren't
going to be explaining concepts like generics or async/await. You'll get more
value from this tutorial, and from Effect, if you're already familiar with the
TypeScript language.

## How we will teach you

Effect is crafted from decades of experience and frustration with building web
applications. It uses advanced features of the TypeScript language and builds on
ideas from functional programming. As a result, **Effect has a steep learning
curve**. But the promise we make you is that **if you invest the time required
to learn Effect, it will pay for itself many times over.**

We're going to teach you Effect by example, starting from familiar ground and
introducing new ideas one at a time. This tutorial isn't going to jump straight
to best practices. To get there, we have to build up a foundation of knowledge
about Effect.

## What we're going to build

We're going to build a backend web application. It will have configuration,
connect to a database, and call out to other APIs.

To put Effect into context, we're going to build our application twice.  First
using [Express][1], a popular web framework for Node.js, and then with Effect.
Don't worry if you don't know or use Express, we'll explain everything as we
go.

This is the code we're going to start with. It defines an Express app with a
single endpoint, `GET /health`, that listens on port 3000.

```ts twoslash title=index.ts
import express from "express"

const app = express()

app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.type("text/plain").send("ok")
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000")
})
```

## Getting set up

To get the most value out of this tutorial, follow along as you read. Copy or
type out the code examples, run them, try changing things to see what happens.
It doesn't matter if you break things, you can always come back and get the
working code.  If all you do is read these words, you'll miss out on the most
important part of learning: doing.

Create a new TypeScript project using your favourite package manager. I'm using
`bun`:

```shell
mkdir express-tutorial
cd express-tutorial
bun init
```

Save our Expresss app into `index.ts` and run it to make sure it works:

```shell
bun add express
bun add -D @types/express
bun index.ts
```

You should see `Server is running on http://localhost:3000` in your terminal,
and visiting `http://localhost:3000/health` should return `ok`.

```http
$ http get localhost:3000/health
HTTP/1.1 200 OK

I'm using [HTTPie](https://httpie.io/cli) throughout this tutorial, because the
output is nicer than `curl`.
