Hi Effecters! 

Welcome back to a **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**), our weekly update that aims to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To begin your Effect journey, take a look at our quick-start guide and documentation below. Enjoy!

[Effect quick-start guide](/docs/quickstart)

[Effect docs](/docs/introduction)

## Overview of TWIE

If you're new to TWIE, here are a few words on what TWIE is and what it aims for.

We’re happy to see the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect. At the same time, we understand that it might not be easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Our Discord server reached **2200+ members** a few days ago and the engagement is at an all-time high.
- We've begun publishing the talks from Effect Days every week. Make sure you don't miss any by [subscribing to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts).
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates** and there has been a lot of activity on GitHub!

We want to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey and actively engage with the community!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content, etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

Now, back to business!

## Community

In the last week, we welcomed +25 new Effecters to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/effect-ts)! Thank you all for joining the Effect community, we're excited to have you on board!

Before we dive into this week's content, we're happy to announce the date of the first [Effect Paris Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/effect-paris/events/300307442/) hosted by [Evryg](https://www.evryg.com). The meetup will be on **Tuesday, April 23, 2024, at 7 p.m.**, and we'd like to remind everyone that it will be in French. Thanks again to the Evryg team, in particular [Jean-Baptiste Musso](https://twitter.com/jbmusso) and [Antoine Coulon](https://twitter.com/c9antoine) for organizing!


### Content Update

A new talk has been released from the Effect Days conference: "Solving the distributed schema problem with @effect/schema" by [Jess Martin](https://twitter.com/jessmartin). In this talk, Jess discusses the concept of local-first software and a new shape of software architecture that involves a peer-to-peer system and moves away from the traditional client-server model. He demonstrates a simple piece of software that follows this architecture, allowing for offline support and real-time collaboration. Check out the video below:

You can find other talks and content from the conference at the [Effect Days playlist](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDf3uQLaK2B9a4tbMgGd9wFeEnMA50z4w) on our YouTube channel.

On another note, Lucas Barake has published a video introducing Effect as ["The TypeScript Library You've Been Waiting For"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X98vwMYxRXw&ab_channel=LucasBarake). Among other things, Lucas demonstrates how to integrate the library into existing code, and shows examples of error handling and HTTP requests. We highly recommend checking out Lucas' video, and are happy to see the community creating educational content and spreading the word about Effect!

This week [Milad Vafaeifard](https://twitter.com/signlanguagete1) showed us how to sign for "Dual" in Effect using sign language. We appreciate Milad's support to the Effect community and his YouTube channel is a great resource for learning web development in sign language.

[Sebastian](https://twitter.com/thefubhy), self-proclaimed as the janitor at Effect, seems to enjoy dropping spoilers. Could there be a big announcement just around the corner? 👀
