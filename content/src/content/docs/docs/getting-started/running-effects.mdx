To execute an effect, you can use one of the many `run` functions provided by the `Effect` module.

<Aside type="tip" title="Running Effects at the Program's Edge">
  The recommended approach is to design your program with the majority of
  its logic as Effects. It's advisable to use the `run*` functions closer
  to the "edge" of your program. This approach allows for greater
  flexibility in executing your program and building sophisticated
  effects.
</Aside>

## runSync

The `Effect.runSync` function executes an effect synchronously, meaning it runs immediately and returns the result.

**Example** (Synchronous Logging)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const program = Effect.sync(() => {
  console.log("Hello, World!")
  return 1
})

const result = Effect.runSync(program)
// Output: Hello, World!

console.log(result)
// Output: 1
```

`Effect.runSync` will throw an error if the effect fails or if it involves any asynchronous operations. In such cases, execution will stop at the point where the asynchronous task occurs:

```ts twoslash collapse={7-9,17-28}
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.runSync(Effect.fail("my error"))
/*
throws:
[Error: my error] {
  name: '(FiberFailure) Error',
  [Symbol(effect/Runtime/FiberFailure/Cause)]: { _tag: 'Fail', error: 'my error' }
  ...
}
*/

Effect.runSync(Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(1)))
/*
throws:
[AsyncFiberException: Fiber #0 cannot be resolved synchronously. This is caused by using runSync on an effect that performs async work] {
  name: '(FiberFailure) AsyncFiberException',
  [Symbol(effect/Runtime/FiberFailure/Cause)]: {
    _tag: 'Die',
    defect: [Fiber #0 cannot be resolved synchronously. This is caused by using runSync on an effect that performs async work] {
      fiber: FiberRuntime {
        ...
      },
      _tag: 'AsyncFiberException',
      name: 'AsyncFiberException'
    }
  }
  ...
}
*/
```

## runSyncExit

`Effect.runSyncExit` runs an effect synchronously, returning the result as an [Exit](/docs/data-types/exit/), which represents the outcome (success or failure) of the effect.

**Example** (Handling Results as Exit)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

console.log(Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.succeed(1)))
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Success",
  value: 1
}
*/

console.log(Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.fail("my error")))
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Failure",
  cause: {
    _id: "Cause",
    _tag: "Fail",
    failure: "my error"
  }
}
*/
```

If the effect involves any asynchronous operations, `Effect.runSyncExit` will return an Exit with a `Die` cause, indicating that the effect can't be resolved synchronously.

**Example** (Asynchronous Operation Resulting in Die)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

console.log(Effect.runSyncExit(Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(1))))
/*
Output:
{
  _id: 'Exit',
  _tag: 'Failure',
  cause: {
    _id: 'Cause',
    _tag: 'Die',
    defect: [Fiber #0 cannot be resolved synchronously. This is caused by using runSync on an effect that performs async work] {
      fiber: [FiberRuntime],
      _tag: 'AsyncFiberException',
      name: 'AsyncFiberException'
    }
  }
}
*/
```

## runPromise

The `Effect.runPromise` function is used to execute an effect and obtain the result as a `Promise`.

**Example** (Running an Effect as a Promise)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.runPromise(Effect.succeed(1)).then(console.log) // Output: 1
```

If the effect fails, `Effect.runPromise` will reject with an error:

```ts twoslash collapse={7-12}
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.runPromise(Effect.fail("my error"))
/*
throws:
[Error: my error] {
  name: '(FiberFailure) Error',
  [Symbol(effect/Runtime/FiberFailure/Cause)]: {
    _tag: 'Fail',
    error: 'my error'
  }
  ...
}
*/
```

## runPromiseExit

The `Effect.runPromiseExit` function runs an effect and returns a `Promise` that resolves to an [Exit](/docs/data-types/exit/), which represents the outcome (success or failure) of the effect.

**Example** (Handling Results as Exit)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.runPromiseExit(Effect.succeed(1)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Success",
  value: 1
}
*/

Effect.runPromiseExit(Effect.fail("my error")).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Failure",
  cause: {
    _id: "Cause",
    _tag: "Fail",
    failure: "my error"
  }
}
*/
```

## runFork

The `Effect.runFork` function is the foundational function for running effects.
It starts a fiber that can be observed or interrupted.
All other run functions are built on top of `runFork`.

<Aside type="tip" title="The Default for Effect Execution">
  Unless you specifically need a `Promise` or synchronous operation,
  `Effect.runFork` is a good default choice.
</Aside>

**Example** (Running an Effect with a Fiber)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Console, Schedule, Fiber } from "effect"

const program = Effect.repeat(
  Console.log("running..."),
  Schedule.spaced("200 millis")
)

const fiber = Effect.runFork(program)

setTimeout(() => {
  Effect.runFork(Fiber.interrupt(fiber))
}, 500)
```

In this example, the `program` continuously logs "running..." with each repetition spaced 200 milliseconds apart. You can learn more about repetitions and scheduling in our [Introduction to Scheduling](/docs/scheduling/introduction/) guide.

To stop the execution of the program, we use `Fiber.interrupt` on the fiber returned by `Effect.runFork`. This allows you to control the execution flow and terminate it when necessary.

For a deeper understanding of how fibers work and how to handle interruptions, check out our guides on [Fibers](/docs/concurrency/fibers/) and [Interruptions](/docs/concurrency/basic-concurrency/#interruptions).

## Synchronous vs. Asynchronous Effects

In the Effect library, there is no built-in way to determine in advance whether an effect will execute synchronously or asynchronously. While this idea was considered in earlier versions of Effect, it was ultimately not implemented for a few important reasons:

1. **Complexity:** Introducing this feature to track sync/async behavior in the type system would make Effect more complex to use and limit its composability.

2. **Safety Concerns:** We experimented with different approaches to track asynchronous Effects, but they all resulted in a worse developer experience without significantly improving safety. Even with fully synchronous types, we needed to support a `fromCallback` combinator to work with APIs using Continuation-Passing Style (CPS). However, at the type level, it's impossible to guarantee that such a function is always called immediately and not deferred.

### Best Practices for Running Effects

In most cases, effects are run at the outermost parts of your application. Typically, an application built around Effect will involve a single call to the main effect. Here’s how you should approach effect execution:

- Use `runPromise` or `runFork`: For most cases, asynchronous execution should be the default. These methods provide the best way to handle Effect-based workflows.

- Use `runSync` only when necessary: Synchronous execution should be considered an edge case, used only in scenarios where asynchronous execution is not feasible. For example, when you are sure the effect is purely synchronous and need immediate results.

## Cheatsheet

The table provides a summary of the available `run*` functions, along with their input and output types, allowing you to choose the appropriate function based on your needs.

| API              | Given          | Result                |
| ---------------- | -------------- | --------------------- |
| `runSync`        | `Effect<A, E>` | `A`                   |
| `runSyncExit`    | `Effect<A, E>` | `Exit<A, E>`          |
| `runPromise`     | `Effect<A, E>` | `Promise<A>`          |
| `runPromiseExit` | `Effect<A, E>` | `Promise<Exit<A, E>>` |
| `runFork`        | `Effect<A, E>` | `RuntimeFiber<A, E>`  |
