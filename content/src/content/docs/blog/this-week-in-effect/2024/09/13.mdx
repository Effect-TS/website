Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) ‚Äì your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you‚Äôll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Recent major updates:

- Effect is API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- [Effect 3.7](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.7) has been released.
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 3540+ members!

## Technology

- We are thrilled to announce the release of a brand new command-line tool for the Effect-TS ecosystem - create-effect-app!

This handy tool streamlines the process of setting up new Effect projects, allowing you to quickly bootstrap either an official Effect example or a project template with Effect and all our recommended developer tooling pre-configured for you. Read the [full release post](https://effect.website/blog/create-effect-app-release) by Maxwell Brown for further details.
