Effect 3.12 has been released! This release includes a number of new features
and improvements. Here's a summary of what's new:

## Effect.fn improvements

- Stack traces will now include the location where the function was defined, not just where it was called.
- A variant has been added that allows you to directly pass the function body.
- `Effect.fnUntraced` has been added which allows you to create a function that is not traced, for when performance is critical.

```ts
import { NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const boomFunction = Effect.fn(function* (n: number) { // line 4
  yield* Effect.annotateCurrentSpan("n", n)
  yield* Effect.fail(new Error("boom")) // line 6
})

boomFunction(42).pipe( // line 9
  Effect.catchAllCause(Effect.logError),
  NodeRuntime.runMain
)

/*
Output:

[09:33:00.998] ERROR (#0):
  Error: boom
      at <anonymous> (/Volumes/Code/effect/effect/scratchpad/fn.ts:6:22)
      at <anonymous> (/Volumes/Code/effect/effect/scratchpad/fn.ts:4:29)
      at <anonymous> (/Volumes/Code/effect/effect/scratchpad/fn.ts:9:1)
*/
```

## Runtime.Context type extractor

You can now easily extract the `R` (requirements) type from a `Runtime`.

```ts
import { Runtime } from "effect"

declare const runtime: Runtime<"ServiceA" | "ServiceB">

// "ServiceA" | "ServiceB"
type Extracted = Runtime.Runtime.Context<typeof runtime>
```

## Context.mergeAll

This API allows you to merge multiple Context instances into a single one.

```ts
import { Context } from "effect"

declare const contextA: Context.Context<"A">
declare const contextB: Context.Context<"B">
declare const contextC: Context.Context<"C">

// Context.Context<"A" | "B" | "C">
const merged = Context.mergeAll(contextA, contextB, contextC)
```

## Cron improvements

- Cron expressions now support second granularity.
- Added `Cron.unsafeParse` which throws an error if the expression is invalid

```ts
import { Cron } from "effect"

// At 04:00:30 on every day-of-month from 8 through 14.
const cron = Cron.unsafeParse("30 0 4 8-14 * 0-6")
const either = Cron.parse("30 0 4 8-14 * 0-6")

// `cron` is a `Cron` instance instead of an `Either` type
```

## Schema additions

Some new schema types & combinators have been added:

- `DateTimeUtcFromDate` - Transform a `Date` to a `DateTime.Utc`.
- `StringFromUriComponent` - Transform a URI component encoded string to a regular string.
- `headNonEmpty` - Get the first element of a non-empty array.

## Other changes
