Effect 3.2.0 has been released! This release includes a number of new features
and improvements. Here's a summary of what's new:

## Chunk.difference & Chunk.differenceWith

These functions allow you to calculate the difference between two `Chunk`'s. This
can be useful when you want to know what elements are in one chunk but not in
another.

```ts
expect(
  Chunk.difference(Chunk.make(1, 2, 3, 4, 5), Chunk.make(1, 2, 3))
).toEqual(Chunk.make(4, 5))
```

## Span's now capture source location

Tracing spans now capture their source location. This can be useful when
debugging and trying to understand where a span was created. It will also add
the source location to any errors created within the span.

To disable this feature, pass `captureStackTrace: false` to the `Effect.withSpan` options:

```ts
Effect.log("Hello World").pipe(
  Effect.withSpan("my span", { captureStackTrace: false })
)
```

## Cause.prettyErrors

You can use this to extract Error instances from a Cause, that have clean stack
traces and have had span information added to them.

This can be useful when integrating Effect with other libraries that expect
Error instances.

## Effect.functionWithSpan

This api allows you to define an effectful function that is wrapped with a span.

You can also use the function arguments to generate the span options.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

const getTodo = Effect.functionWithSpan({
  body: (id: number) => Effect.succeed(`Got todo ${id}!`),
  options: (id) => ({
    name: `getTodo-${id}`,
    attributes: { id }
  })
})
```

## Array.Do notation

Do notation has been added to the `Array` module, for building up arrays in a
sequential manner.

```ts
const props = pipe(
  Array.Do,
  Array.bind("size", () => ["small", "medium", "large"] as const),
  Array.bind(
    "theme",
    () => ["dark", "light", "contrast-light", "contrast-dark"] as const
  ),
  Array.bind("disabled", () => [false, true]),
  Array.bind("loading", () => [false, true])
)
```

## Stream.toReadableStreamEffect

To convert a `Stream` to a `ReadableStream`, that supports using Effect
context / requirements, you can use the `Stream.toReadableStreamEffect` or
`Stream.toReadableStreamRuntime` function.

## $is & $match helpers added to Data.TaggedEnum

The `$is` and `$match` helpers have been added to the
`Data.TaggedEnum.WithGenerics` constructors. You can use these apis to perform
type-safe checks and pattern matching.

```ts
type Result<E, A> = Data.TaggedEnum<{
  Success: { value: A }
  Failure: {
    error: E
    message?: string
  }
}>
interface ResultDefinition extends Data.TaggedEnum.WithGenerics<2> {
  readonly taggedEnum: Result<this["A"], this["B"]>
}
const { $is, $match, Failure, Success } =
  Data.taggedEnum<ResultDefinition>()

const result: Result<string, number> = Success({ value: 1 })

pipe(
  result,
  $match({
    Success: (_) => _.value,
    Failure: (_) => _.error
  })
) satisfies string | number
```
