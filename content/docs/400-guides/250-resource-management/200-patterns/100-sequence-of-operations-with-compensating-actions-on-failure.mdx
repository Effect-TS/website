title: Sequence of Operations with Compensating Actions on Failure
excerpt: Effect facilitates sequential operations where success depends on prior steps, with rollback on failure.

In certain scenarios, you might need to perform a sequence of chained operations where the success of each operation depends on the previous one. However, if any of the operations fail, you would want to reverse the effects of all previous successful operations. This pattern is valuable when you need to ensure that either all operations succeed, or none of them have any effect at all.

Effect offers a way to achieve this pattern using the [Effect.acquireRelease](../scope#defining-resources) function in combination with the [Exit](../../../other/data-types/exit) type.
The [Effect.acquireRelease](../scope#defining-resources) function allows you to acquire a resource, perform operations with it, and release the resource when you're done.
The [Exit](../../../other/data-types/exit) type represents the outcome of an effectful computation, indicating whether it succeeded or failed.

Let's go through an example of implementing this pattern. Suppose we want to create a "Workspace" in our application, which involves creating an S3 bucket, an ElasticSearch index, and a Database entry that relies on the previous two.

To begin, we define the domain model for the required [services](./context-management/services): `S3`, `ElasticSearch`, and `Database`.

```ts twoslash include Services
import { Effect, Context } from "effect"

export class S3Error {
  readonly _tag = "S3Error"
}

export interface Bucket {
  readonly name: string
}

export class S3 extends Context.Tag("S3")<
  S3,
  {
    readonly createBucket: Effect.Effect<Bucket, S3Error>
    readonly deleteBucket: (bucket: Bucket) => Effect.Effect<void>
  }
>() {}

export class ElasticSearchError {
  readonly _tag = "ElasticSearchError"
}

export interface Index {
  readonly id: string
}

export class ElasticSearch extends Context.Tag("ElasticSearch")<
  ElasticSearch,
  {
    readonly createIndex: Effect.Effect<Index, ElasticSearchError>
    readonly deleteIndex: (index: Index) => Effect.Effect<void>
  }
>() {}

export class DatabaseError {
  readonly _tag = "DatabaseError"
}

export interface Entry {
  readonly id: string
}

export class Database extends Context.Tag("Database")<
  Database,
  {
    readonly createEntry: (
      bucket: Bucket,
      index: Index
    ) => Effect.Effect<Entry, DatabaseError>
    readonly deleteEntry: (entry: Entry) => Effect.Effect<void>
  }
>() {}
```

```ts filename="Services.ts" twoslash
// @include: Services
```

Next, we define the three create actions and the overall transaction (`make`) for the Workspace.

We then create simple service implementations to test the behavior of our Workspace code.
To achieve this, we will utilize [layers](./context-management/layers) to construct test services.
These layers will be able to handle various scenarios, including errors, which we can control using the `FailureCase` type.

Let's examine the test results for the scenario where `FailureCase` is set to `undefined` (happy path):

```bash
[S3] creating bucket
[ElasticSearch] creating index
[Database] creating entry for bucket <bucket.name> and index <index.id>
{
  _id: "Either",
  _tag: "Right",
  right: {
    id: "<entry.id>"
  }
}
```

In this case, all operations succeed, and we see a successful result with `right({ id: '<entry.id>' })`.

Now, let's simulate a failure in the `Database`:

```ts
const runnable = Workspace.make.pipe(
  Effect.provide(layer),
  Effect.provideService(FailureCase, "Database")
)
```

The console output will be:

```bash
[S3] creating bucket
[ElasticSearch] creating index
[Database] creating entry for bucket <bucket.name> and index <index.id>
[ElasticSearch] delete index <index.id>
[S3] delete bucket <bucket.name>
{
  _id: "Either",
  _tag: "Left",
  left: {
    _tag: "DatabaseError"
  }
}
```

You can observe that once the `Database` error occurs, there is a complete rollback that deletes the `ElasticSearch` index first and then the associated `S3` bucket. The result is a failure with `left(new DatabaseError())`.

Let's now make the index creation fail instead:

```ts
const runnable = Workspace.make.pipe(
  Effect.provide(layer),
  Effect.provideService(FailureCase, "ElasticSearch")
)
```

In this case, the console output will be:

```bash
[S3] creating bucket
[ElasticSearch] creating index
[S3] delete bucket <bucket.name>
{
  _id: "Either",
  _tag: "Left",
  left: {
    _tag: "ElasticSearchError"
  }
}
```

As expected, once the `ElasticSearch` index creation fails, there is a rollback that deletes the `S3` bucket. The result is a failure with `left(new ElasticSearchError())`.
