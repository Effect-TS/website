Effect 3.10 has been released! This release includes a number of new features
and improvements. Here's a summary of what's new:

## @effect/schema moved to effect/Schema

We are pleased to announce that `@effect/schema` has reached a level of maturity that allows us to merge it into the `effect` package.

This means that you no longer need to install `@effect/schema` separately, and it is now available as `effect/Schema`.

Here is where the various schema modules can now be found:

### Modules

Before

```ts
import {
  Arbitrary,
  AST,
  FastCheck,
  JSONSchema,
  ParseResult,
  Pretty,
  Schema
} from "@effect/schema"
```

After

```ts
import {
  Arbitrary,
  SchemaAST, // changed
  FastCheck,
  JSONSchema,
  ParseResult,
  Pretty,
  Schema
} from "effect"
```

### Formatters

`ArrayFormatter` / `TreeFormatter` has been merged into the `ParseResult` module.

Before

```ts
import { ArrayFormatter, TreeFormatter } from "@effect/schema"
```

After

```ts
import { ArrayFormatter, TreeFormatter } from "effect/ParseResult"
```

### Serializable

Merged into the `Schema` module.

### Equivalence

Merged into the `Schema` module.

Before

```ts
import { Equivalence } from "@effect/schema"

Equivalence.make(myschema)
```

After

```ts
import { Schema } from "effect"

Schema.equivalence(myschema)
```

## HttpApi improvements

The `HttpApi` modules have undergone a number of improvements:

- `HttpApi`, `HttpApiGroup` & `HttpApiEndpoint` now use a chainable api instead
  of a pipeable api.
- `HttpApiMiddleware` module has been added, with an updated way of defining
  security middleware.
- You can now add multiple success schemas
- A url search parameter schema has been added
- Error schemas now support `HttpApiSchema` encoding apis
- `toWebHandler` has been simplified

For more information, see the [README](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/platform/README.md#http-api).

## TSubscriptionRef

The `TSubscriptionRef` module has been added. A `TSubscriptionRef` is from the `STM` family of modules,
which allows you to create a subcribe-able `Ref` that also can be composed with the other `STM` modules, to
create complex atomic operations.

## Stream.fromTQueue & Stream.fromTPubSub

These new apis allow you to create a stream from a `TQueue` or `TPubSub`.

```ts
import { Effect, Stream, TQueue } from "effect"

Effect.gen(function* () {
  const queue = yield* TQueue.unbounded<number>()

  const stream: Stream.Stream<number> = Stream.fromTQueue(queue)
})
```

## Redactable trait

The `Redactable` trait has been added to the `Inspectable` module. It is integrated with the Effect loggers,
to allow you to create data types that can have sensitive data redacted when logged.

```ts
import { Headers } from "@effect/platform"
import { NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { Effect } from "effect"

/*

Output:
[09:18:35.182] INFO (#0):
  { authorization: <redacted> }

*/
Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log(
    Headers.fromInput({
      authorization: "Some secret key"
    })
  )
}).pipe(NodeRuntime.runMain)
```
