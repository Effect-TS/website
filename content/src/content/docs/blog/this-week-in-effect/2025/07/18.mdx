Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below youâ€™ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)


**Recent major updates:**

- Effect crossed [10K Stars on GitHub](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect) ðŸŒŸ.
- Durable workflows in TypeScript with [`@effect/workflow`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/workflow/README.md).
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 4850+ members!
