There are situations where you may encounter unexpected errors, and you need to decide how to handle them. Effect provides functions to help you deal with such scenarios, allowing you to take appropriate actions when errors occur during the execution of your effects.

## Creating Unrecoverable Errors

In the same way it is possible to leverage combinators such as [Effect.fail](/docs/getting-started/creating-effects/#fail) to create values of type `Effect<never, E, never>` the Effect library provides tools to create defects.

Creating defects is a common necessity when dealing with errors from which it is not possible to recover from a business logic perspective, such as attempting to establish a connection that is refused after multiple retries.

In those cases terminating the execution of the effect and moving into reporting, through an output such as stdout or some external monitoring service, might be the best solution.

The following functions and combinators allow for termination of the effect and are often used to convert values of type `Effect<A, E, R>` into values of type `Effect<A, never, R>` allowing the programmer an escape hatch from having to handle and recover from errors for which there is no sensible way to recover.

### die / dieMessage

The `Effect.die` function returns an effect that throws a specified error, while `Effect.dieMessage` throws a `RuntimeException` with a specified text message. These functions are useful for terminating a fiber when a defect, a critical and unexpected error, is detected in the code.

**Example** (Terminating on Division by Zero with `Effect.die`)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const divide = (a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<number> =>
  b === 0
    ? Effect.die(new Error("Cannot divide by zero"))
    : Effect.succeed(a / b)

Effect.runPromise(divide(1, 0))
// throws Error: Cannot divide by zero
```

**Example** (Returning a RuntimeException with `Effect.dieMessage`)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const divide = (a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<number> =>
  b === 0
    ? Effect.dieMessage("Cannot divide by zero")
    : Effect.succeed(a / b)

Effect.runPromise(divide(1, 0))
// throws RuntimeException: Cannot divide by zero
```

### orDie

The `Effect.orDie` function converts an effect's failure into a termination of the fiber, removing the error from the type of the effect. It is useful when you encounter failures that you do not intend to handle or recover from.

**Example** (Converting Failure to Defect with `Effect.orDie`)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const divide = (a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<number, Error> =>
  b === 0
    ? Effect.fail(new Error("Cannot divide by zero"))
    : Effect.succeed(a / b)

//      ┌─── Effect<number, never, never>
//      ▼
const program = Effect.orDie(divide(1, 0))

Effect.runPromise(program)
// throws Error: Cannot divide by zero
```

After using `Effect.orDie`, the error channel type of the `program` is `never`, meaning that the effect no longer handles failures, and will terminate the fiber when an error occurs.

### orDieWith

Similar to `Effect.orDie`, the `Effect.orDieWith` function transforms an effect's failure into a termination of the fiber using a specified mapping function. It allows you to customize the error message before terminating the fiber.

**Example** (Customizing Defect Message with `Effect.orDieWith`)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const divide = (a: number, b: number): Effect.Effect<number, Error> =>
  b === 0
    ? Effect.fail(new Error("Cannot divide by zero"))
    : Effect.succeed(a / b)

//      ┌─── Effect<number, never, never>
//      ▼
const program = Effect.orDieWith(
  divide(1, 0),
  (error) => new Error(`defect: ${error.message}`)
)

Effect.runPromise(program)
// throws Error: defect: Cannot divide by zero
```

After using `Effect.orDieWith`, the error channel type of the `program` is `never`, just like with `Effect.orDie`.

## Catching

There is no sensible way to recover from defects. The functions we're
about to discuss should be used only at the boundary between Effect and
an external system, to transmit information on a defect for diagnostic
or explanatory purposes.

### exit

The `Effect.exit` function transforms an `Effect<A, E, R>` into an effect that encapsulates both potential failure and success within an [Exit](/docs/data-types/exit/) data type:

```ts showLineNumbers=false
Effect<A, E, R> -> Effect<Exit<A, E>, never, R>
```

The resulting effect cannot fail because the potential failure is now represented within the `Exit`'s `Failure` type.
The error type of the returned effect is specified as `never`, confirming that the effect is structured to not fail.

By yielding an `Exit`, we gain the ability to "pattern match" on this type to handle both failure and success cases within the generator function.

**Example** (Catching Defects with `Effect.exit`)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Cause, Console, Exit } from "effect"

// Simulating a runtime error
const task = Effect.dieMessage("Boom!")

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const exit = yield* Effect.exit(task)
  if (Exit.isFailure(exit)) {
    const cause = exit.cause
    if (
      Cause.isDieType(cause) &&
      Cause.isRuntimeException(cause.defect)
    ) {
      yield* Console.log(
        `RuntimeException defect caught: ${cause.defect.message}`
      )
    } else {
      yield* Console.log("Unknown defect caught.")
    }
  }
})

// We get an Exit.Success because we caught all defects
Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
RuntimeException defect caught: Boom!
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Success",
  value: undefined
}
*/
```

### catchAllDefect

The `Effect.catchAllDefect` function allows you to recover from all defects using a provided function.

**Example** (Handling All Defects with `Effect.catchAllDefect`)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Cause, Console } from "effect"

// Simulating a runtime error
const task = Effect.dieMessage("Boom!")

const program = Effect.catchAllDefect(task, (defect) => {
  if (Cause.isRuntimeException(defect)) {
    return Console.log(
      `RuntimeException defect caught: ${defect.message}`
    )
  }
  return Console.log("Unknown defect caught.")
})

// We get an Exit.Success because we caught all defects
Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
RuntimeException defect caught: Boom!
{
  _id: "Exit",
  _tag: "Success",
  value: undefined
}
*/
```

It's important to understand that `Effect.catchAllDefect` can only handle defects, not [expected errors](/docs/error-management/expected-errors/) (such as those caused by `Effect.fail`) or [interruptions](/docs/concurrency/basic-concurrency/#interruptions) in execution (such as when using `Effect.interrupt`).

A defect refers to an error that cannot be anticipated in advance, and there is no reliable way to respond to it. As a general rule, it's recommended to let defects crash the application, as they often indicate serious issues that need to be addressed.

However, in some specific cases, such as when dealing with dynamically loaded plugins, a controlled recovery approach might be necessary. For example, if our application supports runtime loading of plugins and a defect occurs within a plugin, we may choose to log the defect and then reload only the affected plugin instead of crashing the entire application. This allows for a more resilient and uninterrupted operation of the application.

### catchSomeDefect

The `Effect.catchSomeDefect` function in Effect allows you to recover from specific defects using a provided partial function.

**Example** (Handling Specific Defects with `Effect.catchSomeDefect`)

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Cause, Option, Console } from "effect"

// Simulating a runtime error
const task = Effect.dieMessage("Boom!")

const program = Effect.catchSomeDefect(task, (defect) => {
  if (Cause.isIllegalArgumentException(defect)) {
    return Option.some(
      Console.log(
        `Caught an IllegalArgumentException defect: ${defect.message}`
      )
    )
  }
  return Option.none()
})

// Since we are only catching IllegalArgumentException
// we will get an Exit.Failure because we simulated a runtime error.
Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: 'Exit',
  _tag: 'Failure',
  cause: {
    _id: 'Cause',
    _tag: 'Die',
    defect: { _tag: 'RuntimeException' }
  }
}
*/
```

It's important to understand that `catchSomeDefect` can only handle defects, not [expected errors](/docs/error-management/expected-errors/) (such as those caused by `Effect.fail`) or [interruptions](/docs/concurrency/basic-concurrency/#interruptions) in execution (such as when using `Effect.interrupt`).
