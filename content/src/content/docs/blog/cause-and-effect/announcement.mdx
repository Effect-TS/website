We're kicking off **Cause & Effect**, our new podcast where we explore how software engineers are using Effect to build reliable, production-ready software in TypeScript.

Hosted by [Johannes Schickling](https://twitter.com/schickling), each episode brings on different guests to discuss real-world challenges developers face when building robust applications.

Whether you're just starting with Effect or already using it in production, **Cause & Effect** offers insights and practical tips to enhance your development journey with Effect.

## Episode #1 is live!

In the first episode, we chat with [Attila Večerek](https://twitter.com/attilavecerek), Tech Lead & Staff Engineer, about how [Zendesk](https://www.zendesk.com/) has incrementally adopted Effect in a polyglot environment with a large codebase.
