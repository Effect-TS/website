Effect 3.3.0 has been released! This release includes a number of new features
and improvements. Here's a summary of what's new:

## Stream.zipLatestAll

This api can be used to zip multiple streams together. When a value is emitted
by any of the streams, it is combined with the latest values from the other
streams to produce a result.

```ts
import { Stream, Schedule, Console, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.zipLatestAll(
  Stream.fromSchedule(Schedule.spaced("1 millis")),
  Stream.fromSchedule(Schedule.spaced("2 millis")),
  Stream.fromSchedule(Schedule.spaced("4 millis"))
).pipe(Stream.take(6), Stream.tap(Console.log))

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runDrain(stream))
// Output:
// [ 0, 0, 0 ]
// [ 1, 0, 0 ]
// [ 1, 1, 0 ]
// [ 2, 1, 0 ]
// [ 3, 1, 0 ]
// [ 3, 1, 1 ]
// .....
```

## Added queuing strategy option to Stream.toReadableStream

This option is passed to the underlying `ReadableStream` constructor. It allows
you to control the backpressure strategy of the stream.

[See MDN for more information.](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/ReadableStream/ReadableStream#queuingstrategy)

## New options in Pool constructors

New concurrency & resizing options have been added to the Pool constructors, as
well as some performance improvements.

#### concurrency

You can now specify the concurrent access per pool item. This is useful when
you have a pool item that can handle multiple concurrent requests.

#### targetUtilization

This option determines when new pool items are created. It is a value between `0`
and `1`, where `1` means only create new pool items when all the existing items are
fully utilized.

A `targetUtilization` of `0.5` will create new pool items when the existing items are
50% utilized.

By default it is set to `1`,

#### timeToLiveStrategy

This option allows you to specify a strategy that determines how the pool is
resized. The default strategy is `"usage"`, which invalidates pool items based
on the `targetUtilization`.

Another strategy is `"creation"`, which invalidates pool items based on the time
they were created.

## STM.gen, Either.gen & Option.gen now support passing this

The value to bind to `this` can be passed as the first argument to the .gen function.

```ts
import { Option } from "effect"

class MyClass {
  readonly value = 1

  readonly option = Option.gen(this, function* () {
    // you can now access `this.value`
  })
}
```

## New Redacted module

The `Redacted<T>` data type represents sensitive data. It is generic, so it can
be used to redact any type of data.

Support for `Redacted` has been added to @effect/schema & @effect/cli.

The `Secret` module has now been marked as deprecated, and will be removed in a future release.

## Layer annotation APIs

#### Layer.annotateLogs

This api will annotate any logs emitted during the execution of the layer.
Fibers that are forked from the layer will also have their logs annotated.

#### Layer.annotateSpans

Similar to `Layer.annotateLogs`, but for tracing spans.

## Improved URL handling in /platform http client

If you pass a `URL` object to the ClientRequest constructors, it will now also
populate the url parameters & hash of the request.

```ts
// create a request to https://example.com/foo?foo=bar&baz=qux#hash
Http.request
  .get(new URL("https://example.com/?foo=bar#hash"))
  .pipe(
    Http.request.appendUrl("/foo"),
    Http.request.setUrlParam("baz", "qux")
  )
```

## Tuple type guards

The following type guards have been added to the `Predicate` module:

- `isTupleOf` - a refinement that checks if a value is a tuple of a specific length
- `isTupleOfAtLeast` - a refinement that checks if a value is a tuple at least the specified length

## Other changes
