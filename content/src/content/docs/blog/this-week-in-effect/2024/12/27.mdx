Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you‚Äôll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Recent major updates:

- Effect is API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- [Effect 3.12](https://effect.website/blog/releases/effect/312) has been released.
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 3740+ members!

## Happy Holidays from the Effect Team

As we share the final weekly update of the year, we want to thank you for your continued support and contributions to the Effect ecosystem.

2024 has been a year of significant milestones, including the release of Effect 3.0 (our first stable version), the first Effect Days conference in Vienna, and winning The Most Exciting Technology 2024 award at the JSNation conference in Amsterdam. Effect was also featured in numerous meetups and conferences, with more developers choosing it as a topic of discussion.

Additionally, we launched the [Effect Playground](https://effect.website/play) and the new Effect Website 2.0, designed to provide better functionality and an improved user experience.

As we look ahead to 2025, we‚Äôre excited to continue building and growing with you through new technical advancements and community initiatives.

Wishing you happy holidays and a great start to the New Year!

The Effect Team
