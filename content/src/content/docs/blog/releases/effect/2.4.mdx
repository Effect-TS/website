A new minor release of `Effect` has gone out, with some big changes we wanted to let you know about:

- `Schedule<Env, In, Out>` has been changed to `Schedule<Out, In = unknown, Env = never>`. This change makes for cleaner type signatures (`Schedule<void>`) and ensures types are ordered by importance.
- `Either<L, R>` has been changed to `Either<R, L = never>`. This change makes for cleaner type signatures (`Either<void>`) and ensures types are ordered by importance.

For the changes above, a code-mod has been released to make migration as easy as possible.

You can run it by executing:

```bash showLineNumbers=false
npx @effect/codemod minor-2.4 src/**/*
```

It might not be perfect - if you encounter issues, let us know! Also make sure you commit any changes before running it, in case you need to revert anything.

There were several other smaller changes made, feel free to read through the [Changelog](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/7356dd8e6bff6b4842d77de4b7c7305334c8860b/packages/effect/CHANGELOG.md#240) or [Version PR](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2195) to see them all
