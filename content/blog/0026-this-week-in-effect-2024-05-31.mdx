Hi Effecters! 

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**), a weekly update to keep you in the loop with all the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started with Effect, explore our quick-start guide and documentation below.

- [Effect quick-start guide](/docs/quickstart)
- [Effect docs](/docs/introduction)

We want to make it easy for you to find everything you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey and actively engage with the community! Here, you'll find all the significant developments from the previous week, including community activities such as Discord discussions, noteworthy posts, YouTube content, and technical advancements.

**Recent major updates**

- Effect became API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- [Effect 3.2](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.2) has been released.
- Our community on Discord reached **2900+ members**!
