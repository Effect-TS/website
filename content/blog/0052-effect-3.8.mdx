Effect 3.8 has been released! This release includes a number of new features
and improvements. Here's a summary of what's new:

## Logger.withLeveledConsole

With this api you can create a logger that uses the `console.{log,info,warn,error,trace}` functions,
depending on the log level of each message.

This is useful in environments such as browsers, where the different log levels are styled differently.

For example:

```ts
import { Effect, Logger } from "effect"

const loggerLayer = Logger.replace(
  Logger.defaultLogger,
  Logger.withLeveledConsole(Logger.stringLogger)
)

Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.logError("an error")
  yield* Effect.logInfo("an info")
}).pipe(Effect.provide(loggerLayer))
```

## More types implement Effect

Many of the data types in Effect can now be used directly as `Effect`'s.
These include:

- `Ref<A>` - `Effect<A>`, equivalent to `Ref.get`
- `SynchronizedRef<A>` - `Effect<A>`, equivalent to `SynchronizedRef.get`
- `SubscriptionRef<A>` - `Effect<A>`, equivalent to `SubscriptionRef.get`
- `Deferred<A, E>` - `Effect<A, E>`, equivalent to `Deferred.await`
- `Dequeue<A>` - `Effect<A>`, equivalent to `Queue.take`
- `Fiber<A, E>` - `Effect<A, E>`, equivalent to `Fiber.join`
- `FiberRef<A>` - `Effect<A>`, equivalent to `FiberRef.get`

## Semaphore.withPermitsIfAvailable

`Semaphore.withPermitsIfAvailable` will attempt to run an effect immediately if permits are available.
It will return an `Option<A>` from the result of the effect, depending on whether the permits were available.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.gen(function*() {
  const semaphore = yield* Effect.makeSemaphore(1)

  // returns Option.some("foo")
  yield* semaphore.withPermitsIfAvailable(1)(Effect.succeed("foo"))
  // returns Option.none()
  yield* semaphore.withPermitsIfAvailable(2)(Effect.succeed("bar"))
})
```

## Effect.makeLatch

You can create an `Effect.Latch` with `Effect.makeLatch`, which can be used to synchronize multiple effects.

The latch can be opened, closed and waited on.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Create a latch, starting in the closed state
  const latch = yield* Effect.makeLatch(false)

  // Fork a fiber that logs "open sesame" when the latch is opened
  const fiber = yield* Effect.log("open sesame").pipe(
    latch.whenOpen,
    Effect.fork
  )

  // Open the latch
  yield* latch.open

  // Wait for the latch to be opened
  yield* fiber.await

  // Release all waiters, without opening the latch
  yield* latch.release
})
```

## Stream.share

`Stream.share` is a reference counted equivalent of the `Stream.broadcastDynamic` api.

It is useful when you want to share a `Stream`, and ensure any resources are finalized when no more consumers are subscribed.

```ts
import { Effect, Stream } from "effect"

Effect.gen(function*() {
  const sharedStream = yield* Effect.acquireRelease(
    Effect.log("Stream acquired").pipe(
      Effect.as(Stream.never)
    ),
    () => Effect.log("Stream released")
  ).pipe(
    Stream.unwrapScoped,
    Stream.share({ capacity: 16 })
  )

  // Nothing is logged yet

  yield* Stream.runDrain(sharedStream)
  // The upstream will now start emitting values.
  // If the downstream is interrupted, the upstream will also be finalized.
})
```

## HttpClient refactor

The `@effect/platform/HttpClient` module has been refactored to reduce and simplify the api surface.

#### HttpClient.fetch removed

The `HttpClient.fetch` client implementation has been removed. Instead, you can
access a `HttpClient` using the corresponding `Context.Tag`.

```ts
import { FetchHttpClient, HttpClient } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.gen(function* () {
  const client = yield* HttpClient.HttpClient

  // make a get request
  yield* client.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
}).pipe(
  Effect.scoped,
  // the fetch client has been moved to the `FetchHttpClient` module
  Effect.provide(FetchHttpClient.layer)
)
```

#### HttpClient interface now uses methods

Instead of being a function that returns the response, the `HttpClient`
interface now uses methods to make requests.

Some shorthand methods have been added to the `HttpClient` interface to make
less complex requests easier to implement.

```ts
import {
  FetchHttpClient,
  HttpClient,
  HttpClientRequest
} from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.gen(function* () {
  const client = yield* HttpClient.HttpClient

  // make a get request
  yield* client.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
  // make a post request
  yield* client.post("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos")

  // execute a request instance
  yield* client.execute(
    HttpClientRequest.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1")
  )
})
```

#### Scoped HttpClientResponse helpers removed

The `HttpClientResponse` helpers that also supplied the `Scope` have been removed.

Instead, you can use the `HttpClientResponse` methods directly, and explicitly
add a `Effect.scoped` to the pipeline.

```ts
import { FetchHttpClient, HttpClient } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.gen(function* () {
  const client = yield* HttpClient.HttpClient

  yield* client.get("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos/1").pipe(
    Effect.flatMap((response) => response.json),
    Effect.scoped // supply the `Scope`
  )
})
```

#### Some apis have been renamed

Including the `HttpClientRequest` body apis, which is to make them more
discoverable.

## Mailbox module

A new experimental `effect/Mailbox` module has been added. `Mailbox` as an asynchronous queue
that can have a done / failure signal.

It is useful when you want to communicate between effects, and have a way to determine that
the communication is complete.

```ts
import { Chunk, Effect, Mailbox } from "effect"
import * as assert from "node:assert"

Effect.gen(function* () {
  const mailbox = yield* Mailbox.make<number, string>()

  // add messages to the mailbox
  yield* mailbox.offer(1)
  yield* mailbox.offer(2)
  yield* mailbox.offerAll([3, 4, 5])

  // take messages from the mailbox
  const [messages, done] = yield* mailbox.takeAll
  assert.deepStrictEqual(Chunk.toReadonlyArray(messages), [1, 2, 3, 4, 5])
  assert.strictEqual(done, false)

  // signal that the mailbox is done
  yield* mailbox.end
  const [messages2, done2] = yield* mailbox.takeAll
  assert.deepStrictEqual(messages2, Chunk.empty())
  assert.strictEqual(done2, true)

  // signal that the mailbox is failed
  yield* mailbox.fail("boom")

  // turn the mailbox into a stream
  const stream = Mailbox.toStream(mailbox)
})
```

## FiberRef performance improvements

Some common `FiberRef` instances are now cached, which improves performance of the Effect runtime.

## RcMap.keys & MutableMap.keys

You can now access the available keys of a `RcMap` or `MutableMap` using the `keys` api.

For example:

```ts
const map = MutableHashMap.make([["a", "a"], ["b", "b"], ["c", "c"]])
const keys = MutableHashMap.keys(map) // ["a", "b", "c"]
```

And for `RcMap`:

```ts
Effect.gen(function* () {
  const map = yield* RcMap.make({
    lookup: (key) => Effect.succeed(key)
  })

  yield* RcMap.get(map, "a")
  yield* RcMap.get(map, "b")
  yield* RcMap.get(map, "c")

  const keys = yield* RcMap.keys(map) // ["a", "b", "c"]
})
```

## Duration conversion apis

Some new apis for converting between a `Duration` and it's corresponding parts have been added:

- `Duration.toMinutes`
- `Duration.toHours`
- `Duration.toDays`
- `Duration.toWeeks`
- `Duration.parts`
