Check out what's been happening in the Effect community this month! We've had the pleasure of sharing some key moments from last month's Effect Days conference, but not only. Let's dive right in!

## Effect Days conference recap

We can't help but feel a sense of awe and gratitude for the experience we shared during those intense days fully dedicated to Effect and filled with insightful talks and engaging workshops.

We had an amazing time connecting with the community, exchanging ideas, sharing stories, and forging new friendships. The [Effect Days highlight video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=CfbR-1XRlTA&ab_channel=Effect%7CTypeScriptatScale) we shared a few weeks ago offers only a glimpse of the vibrant energy we experienced during those days.

It was indeed a privilege to gather together such a diverse and talented group of individuals and Effect developers, each bringing their own unique perspectives and expertise to the conversation.

The day before the conference, [Ethan Niser](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3Ii5Ny-FVIg&ab_channel=Effect%7CTypeScriptatScale) and [Maxwell Brown](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=naI9vNF801w&ab_channel=Effect%7CTypeScriptatScale) led two full-day Effect workshops on various topics of the Effect ecosystem. The [feedback from attendees](https://x.com/EffectTS_/status/1770783115788562573?s=20) has been overwhelmingly positive, and it's inspiring to see such enthusiasm for learning more about Effect.

For many of us, Effect Days was a reminder of the incredible things that can happen when passionate people come together to learn, connect, and grow.

And let's not forget the fun moments during the Mario Kart tournament and the intense laser tag session, with thrilling battles, resulting in a few victorious champions and one honorable casualty.

If you couldn't make it to the conference, no worries! You can catch up on the [opening keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PxIBWjiv3og&ab_channel=Effect%7CTypeScriptatScale) by Johannes Schickling on our YouTube channel.

## Effect community spotlight

We want to shine a spotlight on [Milad Vafaeifard](https://www.linkedin.com/in/miladvafaeifard/) for his contributions and for simply bringing positive energy, particularly at Effect Days. Following the conference, Milad shared a very interesting video about his experience in Vienna and his journey with Effect.

Milad runs his own [YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@SignLanguageTech), where he shares educational content on software development, including Effect. Recently, he even created a unique sign for "Effect" in sign language.

## Effect community event

Mark your calendars for the [Effect Paris Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/fr-FR/effect-paris/) coming up in April. an exciting opportunity to dive into insightful discussions, expand your knowledge, and network with fellow French-speaking Effect developers. The meetup is being organized by Jean-Baptiste Musso and Antoine Coulon from Evryg, an independent software development company based in Paris. Stay tuned for updates on the meetup schedule!
