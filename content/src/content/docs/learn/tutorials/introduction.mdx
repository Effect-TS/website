In this tutorial we're going to migrate an Express.js app to Effect. We'll learn
how to configure your existing Express.js codebase to allow migrating endpoints
one at a time, adopting Effect incrementally. We'll start with the base set of
Effect concepts you'll need to migrate the simplest endpoint possible, and we'll
introduce new concepts as we migrate more complex endpoints.

## Our Express.js app

We'll start with a simple Express.js app that has a single health checking
endpoint.

```ts twoslash
import express from "express"

const app = express()

app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.type("text/plain").send("ok")
})

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log("Server is running on http://localhost:3000")
})
```

Create a new TypeScript project using your favourite package manager. I'm using
`bun`:

```shell
mkdir express-to-effect
cd express-to-effect
bun init
```

Save our Express.js app into `index.ts` and run it to make sure it works:

```shell
bun add express
bun run index.ts
```

You should see `Server is running on http://localhost:3000` in your terminal,
and visiting `http://localhost:3000/health` should return `ok`.

## Migrating to Effect

The first step to migrating this to Effect is to launch the Express.js server
with Effect instead of the traditional `app.listen`. Because the Express.js
`app` is a function that returns a node `http.Server` under the hood, it slots
nicely into Effect's `HttpServer` abstraction.

```ts twoslash
import express from "express"

// New imports
import { HttpRouter, HttpServer } from "@effect/platform"
import { NodeHttpServer, NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { Layer } from "effect"
import { createServer } from "node:http"

const app = express()

app.get("/health", (req, res) => {
  res.type("text/plain").send("ok")
})

// New server runner
NodeRuntime.runMain(
  Layer.launch(
    Layer.provide(
      HttpServer.serve(HttpRouter.empty),
      NodeHttpServer.layer(() => createServer(app), { port: 3000 }),
    ),
  ),
)
```

And we can run the resulting code like so:

```shell
bun add @effect/platform @effect/platform-node
bun run index.ts
```

We haven't changed anything about how the server behaves. It still exposes a
single endpoint, `http://localhost:3000/health`, and that still returns `ok`.
But we've wrapped the Express.js app in a way that will allow us to define new
endpoints using Express while still responding to our existing endpoints in
Express.js.

There's a lot of new things happening at the bottom of our file. For the time
being we're going to ignore most of it and focus on migrating an endpoint to
Effect. I promise by the time we're done, you'll understand every line we added
above.

First, let's break out our router, `HttpRouter.empty`, out into its own variable
so it's easier to add to.

```ts twoslash
import { HttpRouter } from "@effect/platform"
// ---cut---
const router = HttpRouter.empty
```

And let's define the function we want to run when we hit the `/health` endpoint:

```ts twoslash
import { HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
// ---cut---
function health() {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
}
```

`HttpServerResponse` is Effect's class for generating HTTP responses, we need to
use it for any responses returned from our endpoints defined with Effect.

The way we wire these things together is going to look a bit strange, but bear
with me.

```ts twoslash
import { HttpServerResponse, HttpRouter } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"
// ---cut---
function health() {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
}

const router = HttpRouter.empty.pipe(
  HttpRouter.get("/health", Effect.sync(health)),
)
```

What on earth are `Effect.sync` and `.pipe`?

## The Effect Type

At the core of Effect is... well, the `Effect`. An `Effect` is what's called a
"thunk", which you can think of as a lazy computation. It doesn't do anything
until you run it.

Here are some examples of simple `Effect`s:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"
// ---cut---
const sync = Effect.sync(() => "Hello, world!")
const promise = Effect.promise(async () => "Hello, world!")
const succeed = Effect.succeed("Hello, world!")
```

Above we have examples of synchronous, asynchronous, and static Effects. None of
them will do anything as defined there, they need to be run. There are several
ways to run Effects.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"
const sync = Effect.sync(() => "Hello, world!")
const promise = Effect.promise(async () => "Hello, world!")
const succeed = Effect.succeed("Hello, world!")
// ---cut---
const resultSync = Effect.runSync(sync)
const resultPromise = await Effect.runPromise(promise);
const resultSucceed = Effect.runSync(succeed)

console.log(resultSync)
// "Hello, world!"
console.log(resultPromise)
// "Hello, world!"
console.log(resultSucceed)
// "Hello, world!"
```

This prints out `"Hello, world!"` three times. Note that you have to run
synchronous and asynchronous Effects differently, `runSync` and `runPromise`
respectively.

What if you want to run an Effect that calls another Effect? You can use
`Effect.gen` to do that:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"
const promise = Effect.promise(async () => "Hello, world!")
// ---cut---
const gen = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const result = yield* promise
  return result.toUpperCase()
})

const resultGen = await Effect.runPromise(gen)
console.log(resultGen)
// "HELLO, WORLD!"
```

Given that all we really want to do above is call `.toUpperCase()` on the result
of `promise`, the scaffolding of `Effect.gen` feels a bit heavy. Effect gives us
plenty of tools to work with `Effect`s, one of which is `pipe`:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"
const promise = Effect.promise(async () => "Hello, world!")
// ---cut---
const upper = promise.pipe(Effect.map((s) => s.toUpperCase()))
const result = await Effect.runPromise(upper)
console.log(result)
// "HELLO, WORLD!"
```

`pipe` passes the result of one computation as input to another. Here,
`Effect.map` transforms the result of the first `Effect` with the function
provided.

We can `pipe` as many `Effect`s together as we like:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"
const promise = Effect.promise(async () => "Hello, world!")
// ---cut---
const upper = promise.pipe(
  Effect.map((s) => s.toUpperCase()),
  Effect.map((s) => s.split("")),
  Effect.map((s) => s.reverse()),
  Effect.map((s) => s.join("")),
)
const result = await Effect.runPromise(upper)
console.log(result)
// "!DLROW ,OLLEH"
```

## Understanding `HttpRouter`

Looking back at `HttpRouter`, we used `pipe` to add a new endpoint to our app:

```ts twoslash
import { HttpRouter, HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"
function health() {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
}
// ---cut---
const router = HttpRouter.empty.pipe(
  HttpRouter.get("/health", Effect.sync(health)),
);
```

`HttpRouter` is a data structure that represents a collection of routes. The
simplest router is one with no routes at all, and Effect exposes that to us as
the `HttpRouter.empty` value. Under the hood, this is itself an `Effect`:

```ts twoslash
import { HttpRouter } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"
// ---cut---
console.log(Effect.isEffect(HttpRouter.empty))
// true
```

The helper `HttpRouter.get` takes as input an `HttpRouter` and returns a new
`HttpRouter` with the given route added. If we wanted to, we could have done
this much more directly:

```ts twoslash
import { HttpRouter, HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"
function health() {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
}
// ---cut---
const router = HttpRouter.get("/health", Effect.sync(health))(HttpRouter.empty)
```

This is exactly the same as the `pipe` version, except that if we wanted to add
multiple routes it gets unwieldy quickly:

```ts twoslash
import { HttpRouter, HttpServerResponse } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"
function health() {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
}
function status() {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
}
function version() {
  return HttpServerResponse.text("ok")
}
// ---cut---
HttpRouter.get("/health", Effect.sync(health))(
  HttpRouter.get("/status", Effect.sync(status))(
    HttpRouter.get("/version", Effect.sync(version))(
      HttpRouter.empty,
    ),
  ),
)

// vs

HttpRouter.empty.pipe(
  HttpRouter.get("/version", Effect.sync(version)),
  HttpRouter.get("/status", Effect.sync(status)),
  HttpRouter.get("/health", Effect.sync(health)),
)
```
