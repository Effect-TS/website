Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

## Effect Days 2025: Recap & Takeaways

From March 19-21, we gathered at Palazzo Pancaldi in Livorno for Effect Days 2025, our annual community event, to bring the community together, showcase real-world use cases of Effect in production, and unveil the latest developments for the coming year. Here’s a recap of the highlights for each day:


### Day 1: Workshop Day

The event kicked off with a full day of hands-on workshops, the morning session led by Maxwell Brown and the afternoon by Tim Smart.

The final day focused on community, collaboration, and shared exploration. We hosted a quiet-yet-intense chess simul that added a thoughtful (and fun) twist to the day and revealed that we have some seriously strong chess players in the community! The atmosphere throughout reflected the core of Effect Days — connection, curiosity, and genuine community.
