Hi Effecters! 

Welcome back to a **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**), our weekly update that aims to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To begin your Effect journey, take a look at our quick-start guide and documentation below. Enjoy!

[Effect quick-start guide](/docs/quickstart)

[Effect docs](/docs/introduction)

## Overview of TWIE

If you're new to TWIE, here are a few words on what TWIE is and what it aims for.

We’re happy to see the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect. At the same time, we understand that it might not be easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Effect became API stable with the Effect 3.0 release.
- Our Discord server reached **2420+ members** a few days ago and the engagement is at an all-time high.
- We've begun publishing the talks from Effect Days every week. Make sure you don't miss any by [subscribing to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts).
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates** and there has been a lot of activity on GitHub!

We want to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey and actively engage with the community!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content, etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

Now, back to business!


## Technology

We'd like to draw your attention to a small update that will bring a huge benefit to anyone using Effect: **with patch 3.0.4 (alredy released), Effect no longer needs an adapter function in order to yield effects!** Scroll down for the PR.

## Community

In the last week, we welcomed +140 new Effecters to our [Discord server](https://discord.gg/effect-ts)! Thank you all for joining the Effect community, we're excited to have you on board!

The first [Effect Paris Meetup](https://www.meetup.com/effect-paris/events/300307442) happened this week and we heard it was a success! It's incredibly exciting to witness the rapid growth of the Effect community in France. A huge thank you goes out to the Evryg team, in particular [Jean-Baptiste Musso](https://twitter.com/jbmusso) and [Antoine Coulon](https://twitter.com/c9antoine) for organizing and hosting the event.

### Content Update

On Monday we posted one of the most anticipated talks from the Effect Days conference, "Why Effect is more important than ZIO" by [John De Goes](https://twitter.com/jdegoes). John is the author of [ZIO](https://zio.dev) & founder of [Ziverge](https://www.ziverge.com) and [Golem Cloud](https://www.golem.cloud), and also, Grandfather of Effect (cit. [Sebatian Lorenz](https://twitter.com/thefubhy)).

In this talk, John discusses the history and design decisions of ZIO, the birth and evolution of Effect, and the reasons why he believes Effect is here to stay and will have a bigger impact on commercial functional programming than ZIO.

We're happy to see more and more developers and content creators recognizing the value of the Effect library and introducing it to their projects. It's exciting to see Effect gaining traction and making a positive impact in the community.
