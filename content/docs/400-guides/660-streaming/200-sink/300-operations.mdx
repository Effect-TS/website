In the previous sections, we learned how to create and use sinks. Now, let's explore some operations you can perform on sinks to transform or filter their behavior.

## Changing the Input

Sometimes, you have a sink that works perfectly with one type of input, but you want to use it with a different type. This is where `Sink.mapInput` comes in handy. While `map` modifies the output of a function, `mapInput` modifies the input. It allows you to adapt your sink to work with a different input.

Imagine you have a `Sink.sum` that calculates the sum of incoming numeric values. However, your stream contains strings, not numbers. You can use `mapInput` to convert your strings into numbers and make `Sink.sum` compatible with your stream:

```ts twoslash
import { Stream, Sink, Effect } from "effect"

const numericSum = Sink.sum

const stringSum = numericSum.pipe(
  Sink.mapInput((s: string) => Number.parseFloat(s))
)

Effect.runPromise(
  Stream.make("1", "2", "3", "4", "5").pipe(Stream.run(stringSum))
).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
15
*/
```

## Transforming Both Input and Output

If you need to change both the input and output of a sink, you can use `Sink.dimap`. It's an extended version of `mapInput` that lets you transform both types. This can be useful when you need to perform a complete conversion between your input and output types:

```ts twoslash
import { Stream, Sink, Effect } from "effect"

// Convert its input to integers, do the computation and then convert them back to a string
const sumSink = Sink.sum.pipe(
  Sink.dimap({
    onInput: (s: string) => Number.parseFloat(s),
    onDone: (n) => String(n)
  })
)

Effect.runPromise(
  Stream.make("1", "2", "3", "4", "5").pipe(Stream.run(sumSink))
).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
15 <-- as string
*/
```

## Filtering Input

Sinks offer a way to filter incoming elements using `Sink.filterInput`. This allows you to collect or process only the elements that meet a specific condition. In the following example, we collect elements in chunks of three and filter out the negative numbers:

```ts twoslash
import { Stream, Sink, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.make(1, -2, 0, 1, 3, -3, 4, 2, 0, 1, -3, 1, 1, 6).pipe(
  Stream.transduce(
    Sink.collectAllN<number>(3).pipe(Sink.filterInput((n) => n > 0))
  )
)

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runCollect(stream)).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [
    {
      _id: "Chunk",
      values: [ 1, 1, 3 ]
    }, {
      _id: "Chunk",
      values: [ 4, 2, 1 ]
    }, {
      _id: "Chunk",
      values: [ 1, 1, 6 ]
    }, {
      _id: "Chunk",
      values: []
    }
  ]
}
*/
```
