In the previous sections, we learned how to [create](./creating-effects) effects and [execute](./running-effects) them. Now, it's time to write our first simple program.

Effect offers a convenient syntax, similar to `async`/`await`, to write effectful code using [generators](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Generator).

<Idea>
  The use of generators is an **optional feature** in Effect. If you find
  generators unfamiliar or prefer a different coding style, you can explore
  the documentation about [Building Pipelines](./pipeline) in Effect.

## Understanding Effect.gen

The `Effect.gen` utility simplifies the task of writing effectful code by utilizing JavaScript's generator functions. This method helps your code appear and behave more like traditional synchronous code, which enhances both readability and error management.

Let's explore a practical program that performs a series of data transformations commonly found in application logic:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

// Function to add a small service charge to a transaction amount
const addServiceCharge = (amount: number) => amount + 1

// Function to apply a discount safely to a transaction amount
const applyDiscount = (
  total: number,
  discountRate: number
): Effect.Effect<number, Error> =>
  discountRate === 0
    ? Effect.fail(new Error("Discount rate cannot be zero"))
    : Effect.succeed(total - (total * discountRate) / 100)

// Simulated asynchronous task to fetch a transaction amount from a database
const fetchTransactionAmount = Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(100))

// Simulated asynchronous task to fetch a discount rate from a configuration file
const fetchDiscountRate = Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(5))

// Assembling the program using a generator function
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  // Retrieve the transaction amount
  const transactionAmount = yield* fetchTransactionAmount

  // Retrieve the discount rate
  const discountRate = yield* fetchDiscountRate

  // Calculate discounted amount
  const discountedAmount = yield* applyDiscount(
    transactionAmount,
    discountRate
  )

  // Apply service charge
  const finalAmount = addServiceCharge(discountedAmount)

  // Return the total amount after applying the charge
  return `Final amount to charge: ${finalAmount}`
})

// Execute the program and log the result
Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log) // Output: "Final amount to charge: 96"
```

Key steps to follow when using `Effect.gen`:

- Wrap your logic in `Effect.gen`
- Use `yield*` to handle effects
- Return the final result

<Warning>
  The generator API is only available when using the `downlevelIteration` flag
  or with a `target` of `"es2015"` or higher in your `tsconfig.json` file
</Warning>

## Comparing Effect.gen with async/await

If you are familiar with `async`/`await`, you may notice that the flow of writing code is similar.

Let's compare the two approaches:

  <Tab>

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"
// ---cut---
const addServiceCharge = (amount: number) => amount + 1

const applyDiscount = (
  total: number,
  discountRate: number
): Effect.Effect<number, Error> =>
  discountRate === 0
    ? Effect.fail(new Error("Discount rate cannot be zero"))
    : Effect.succeed(total - (total * discountRate) / 100)

const fetchTransactionAmount = Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(100))

const fetchDiscountRate = Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(5))

export const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const transactionAmount = yield* fetchTransactionAmount
  const discountRate = yield* fetchDiscountRate
  const discountedAmount = yield* applyDiscount(
    transactionAmount,
    discountRate
  )
  const finalAmount = addServiceCharge(discountedAmount)
  return `Final amount to charge: ${finalAmount}`
})
```

  </Tab>
  <Tab>

```ts twoslash
const addServiceCharge = (amount: number) => amount + 1

const applyDiscount = (
  total: number,
  discountRate: number
): Promise<number> =>
  discountRate === 0
    ? Promise.reject(new Error("Discount rate cannot be zero"))
    : Promise.resolve(total - (total * discountRate) / 100)

const fetchTransactionAmount = Promise.resolve(100)

const fetchDiscountRate = Promise.resolve(5)

export const program = async function () {
  const transactionAmount = await fetchTransactionAmount
  const discountRate = await fetchDiscountRate
  const discountedAmount = await applyDiscount(
    transactionAmount,
    discountRate
  )
  const finalAmount = addServiceCharge(discountedAmount)
  return `Final amount to charge: ${finalAmount}`
}
```

  </Tab>
</Tabs>

It's important to note that although the code appears similar, the two programs are not identical. The purpose of comparing them side by side is just to highlight the resemblance in how they are written.

## Embracing Control Flow

One significant advantage of using `Effect.gen` in conjunction with generators is its capability to employ standard control flow constructs within the generator function. These constructs include `if`/`else`, `for`, `while`, and other branching and looping mechanisms, enhancing your ability to express complex control flow logic in your code.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const calculateTax = (
  amount: number,
  taxRate: number
): Effect.Effect<number, Error> =>
  taxRate > 0
    ? Effect.succeed((amount * taxRate) / 100)
    : Effect.fail(new Error("Invalid tax rate"))

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  let i = 1

  while (true) {
    if (i === 10) {
      break // Break the loop when counter reaches 10
    } else {
      if (i % 2 === 0) {
        // Calculate tax for even numbers
        console.log(yield* calculateTax(100, i))
      }
      i++
      continue
    }
  }
})

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
2
4
6
8
*/
```

## Raising Errors

The `Effect.gen` API allows you to incorporate error handling directly into your program flow by yielding failed effects.
This mechanism, achieved through `Effect.fail`, is demonstrated in the example below:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  console.log("Task1...")
  console.log("Task2...")
  // Introduce an error into the flow
  yield* Effect.fail("Something went wrong!")
})

Effect.runPromiseExit(program).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Task1...
Task2...
{
  _id: 'Exit',
  _tag: 'Failure',
  cause: { _id: 'Cause', _tag: 'Fail', failure: 'Something went wrong!' }
}
*/
```

### The Role of Short-Circuiting

When working with the `Effect.gen` API, it's important to understand how it manages errors.
This API is designed to **short-circuit the execution** upon encountering the **first error**.

What does this mean for you as a developer? Well, let's say you have a chain of operations or a collection of effects to be executed in sequence. If any error occurs during the execution of one of these effects, the remaining computations will be skipped, and the error will be propagated to the final result.

In simpler terms, the short-circuiting behavior ensures that if something goes wrong at any step of your program it will immediately stop and return the error to let you know that something went wrong.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  console.log("Task1...")
  console.log("Task2...")
  yield* Effect.fail("Something went wrong!")
  console.log("This won't be executed")
})

Effect.runPromise(program).then(console.log, console.error)
/*
Output:
Task1...
Task2...
(FiberFailure) Error: Something went wrong!
*/
```

## Passing this

In some cases, you might need to pass a reference to the current object (`this`) into the body of your generator function.
You can achieve this by utilizing an overload that accepts the reference as the first argument:

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

class MyService {
  readonly local = 1
  compute = Effect.gen(this, function* () {
    return yield* Effect.succeed(this.local + 1)
  })
}

console.log(Effect.runSync(new MyService().compute)) // Output: 2
```

## Adapter

You may still come across some code snippets that use an adapter, typically indicated by `_` or `$` symbols.

In earlier versions of TypeScript, the generator "adapter" function was necessary to ensure correct type inference within generators. This adapter was used to facilitate the interaction between TypeScript's type system and generator functions.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect } from "effect"

const fetchTransactionAmount = Effect.promise(() => Promise.resolve(100))

// Older usage with an adapter for proper type inference
const programWithAdapter = Effect.gen(function* (_ /* <-- Adapter */) {
  const transactionAmount = yield* _(fetchTransactionAmount)
})

// Current usage without an adapter
const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const transactionAmount = yield* fetchTransactionAmount
})
```

With advances in TypeScript (v5.5+), the adapter is no longer necessary for type inference. While it remains in the codebase for backward compatibility, it is anticipated to be removed in the upcoming major release of Effect.
