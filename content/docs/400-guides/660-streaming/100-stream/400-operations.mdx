In this section, we'll explore some essential operations you can perform on streams. These operations allow you to manipulate and interact with stream elements in various ways.

## Tapping

Tapping is an operation that involves running an effect on each emission of the stream. It allows you to observe each element, perform some effectful operation, and discard the result of this observation. Importantly, the `Stream.tap` operation does not alter the elements of the stream, and it does not affect the return type of the stream.

For instance, you can use `Stream.tap` to print each element of a stream:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/tap.ts

```

## Taking Elements

Another essential operation is taking elements, which allows you to extract a specific number of elements from a stream. Here are several ways to achieve this:

- `take`. To extract a fixed number of elements.
- `takeWhile`. To extract elements until a certain condition is met.
- `takeUntil`. To extract elements until a specific condition is met.
- `takeRight`. To extract a specified number of elements from the end.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/take.ts

```

### Exploring Streams as an Alternative to Async Iterables

When working with asynchronous data sources, like async iterables, you often need to consume data in a loop until a certain condition is met. This tutorial introduces how you can achieve similar behavior using Streams in a beginner-friendly manner.

In async iterables, data consumption can continue in a loop until a break or return statement is encountered. To replicate this behavior with Streams, you have a couple of options:

1. **Stream.takeUntil:** This function allows you to take elements from a stream until a specified condition evaluates to true. It's akin to breaking out of a loop in async iterables when a certain condition is met.

2. **Stream.toPull:** The `Stream.toPull` function is another way to replicate looping through async iterables. It returns an effect that repeatedly pulls data chunks from the stream. This effect can fail with `None` when the stream is finished or with `Some` error if it fails.

Let's take a closer look at the second option, `Stream.toPull`.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/toPull.ts

```

In this example, we're using `Stream.toPull` to repeatedly pull data chunks from the `stream`. The code enters a loop and continues to fetch and display chunks until there's no more data left to process.

## Mapping

In this section, we'll explore how to transform elements within a stream using the `Stream.map` family of operations. These operations allow you to apply a function to each element of the stream, producing a new stream with the transformed values.

### Basic Mapping

The `Stream.map` operation applies a given function to all elements of the stream, creating another stream with the transformed values. Let's illustrate this with an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/map.ts

```

### Effectful Mapping

If your transformation involves effects, you can use `Stream.mapEffect` instead. It allows you to apply an effectful function to each element of the stream, producing a new stream with effectful results:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/mapEffect.ts

```

You can evaluate effects concurrently using the `concurrency` option. It allows you to specify the number of concurrent running effects. The results are emitted downstream in the original order.

Let's write a simple page downloader that fetches URLs concurrently:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/mapEffectPar.ts

```

### Stateful Mapping

The `Stream.mapAccum` operation is similar to `map`, but it transforms elements statefully and allows you to map and accumulate in a single operation. Let's see how you can use it to calculate the running total of an input stream:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/mapAccum.ts

```

### Mapping and Flattening

The `Stream.mapConcat` operation is akin to `Stream.map`, but it takes things a step further. It maps each element to zero or more elements of type `Iterable` and then flattens the entire stream. Let's illustrate this with an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/mapConcat.ts

```

In this example, we take a stream of strings like `"1-2-3"` and split them into individual numbers, resulting in a flattened stream of integers.

### Mapping to a Constant Value

The `Stream.as` method allows you to map the success values of a stream to a specified constant value. This can be handy when you want to transform elements into a uniform value. Here's an example where we map all elements to the `null` value:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/as.ts

```

In this case, regardless of the original values in the stream, we've mapped them all to `null`.

## Filtering

The `Stream.filter` operation is like a sieve that lets through elements that meet a specified condition. Think of it as a way to sift through a stream and keep only the elements that satisfy the given criteria. Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/filter.ts

```

In this example, we start with a stream of numbers from 1 to 10 and use `Stream.filter` to retain only the even numbers (those that satisfy the condition `n % 2 === 0`). The result is a filtered stream containing the even numbers from the original stream.

## Scanning

In this section, we'll explore the concept of stream scanning. Scans are similar to folds, but they provide a historical perspective. Like folds, scans also involve a binary operator and an initial value. However, what makes scans unique is that they emit every intermediate result as part of the stream.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/scan.ts

```

In this example, we have a stream of numbers from 1 to 5, and we use `Stream.scan` to perform a cumulative addition starting from an initial value of 0. The result is a stream that emits the accumulated sum at each step: 0, 1, 3, 6, 10, and 15.

Streams scans provide a way to keep a historical record of your stream transformations, which can be invaluable for various applications.

Additionally, if you only need the final result of the scan, you can use `Stream.runFold`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/runFold.ts

```

In this case, `Stream.runFold` gives you the final accumulated value, which is 15 in this example.

## Draining

In this section, we'll explore the concept of stream draining. Imagine you have a stream filled with effectful operations, but you're not interested in the values they produce; instead, you want to execute these effects and discard the results. This is where the `Stream.drain` function comes into play.

Let's go through a few examples:

**Example 1: Discarding Values**

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/drain-empty.ts

```

In this example, we have a stream with values from 1 to 5, but we use `Stream.drain` to discard these values. As a result, the output stream is empty.

**Example 2: Executing Random Effects**

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/drain.ts

```

In this example, we create a stream with random effects and collect the values of these effects initially. Later, we use `Stream.drain` to execute the same effects without collecting the values. This demonstrates how you can use draining to trigger effectful operations when you're not interested in the emitted values.

Stream draining can be particularly useful when you need to perform certain actions or cleanup tasks in your application without affecting the main stream of data.

## Detecting Changes in a Stream

In this section, we'll explore the `Stream.changes` operation, which allows you to detect and emit elements that are different from their preceding elements within the stream.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/changes.ts

```

## Zipping

Zipping is a process of combining two or more streams to create a new stream by pairing elements from the input streams. We can achieve this using the `Stream.zip` and `Stream.zipWith` operators. Let's dive into some examples:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/zip.ts

```

The new stream will end when one of the streams ends.

### Handling Stream Endings

When one of the input streams ends before the other, you might need to zip with default values. The `Stream.zipAll` and `Stream.zipAllWith` operations allow you to specify default values for both sides to handle such scenarios. Let's see an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/zipAll.ts

```

This allows you to handle zipping when one stream completes earlier than the other.

### Zipping Streams at Different Rates

Sometimes, you might have two streams producing elements at different speeds. If you don't want to wait for the slower one when zipping elements, you can use `Stream.zipLatest` or `Stream.zipLatestWith`. These operations combine elements in a way that when a value is emitted by either of the two streams, it is combined with the latest value from the other stream to produce a result. Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/zipLatest.ts

```

Here, `Stream.zipLatest` combines elements from both streams without waiting for the slower one, resulting in a more responsive output.

### Pairing with Previous and Next Elements

- `zipWithPrevious`: This operator pairs each element of a stream with its previous element.

- `zipWithNext`: It pairs each element of a stream with its next element.

- `zipWithPreviousAndNext`: This operator pairs each element with both its previous and next elements.

Here's an example illustrating these operations:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/zipWithPrevious.ts

```

### Indexing Stream Elements

Another handy operator is `Stream.zipWithIndex`, which indexes each element of a stream by pairing it with its respective index. This is especially useful when you need to keep track of the position of elements within the stream.

Here's an example of indexing elements in a stream:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/zipWithIndex.ts

```

## Cartesian Product of Streams

The Stream module introduces a powerful feature: the ability to compute the _Cartesian Product_ of two streams. This operation allows you to generate combinations of elements from two separate streams. Let's explore this concept further:

Imagine you have two sets of items, and you want to generate all possible pairs by taking one item from each set. This process is known as finding the Cartesian Product of the sets. In the context of streams, it means creating combinations of elements from two streams.

To achieve this, the Stream module provides the `Stream.cross` operator, along with its variants. These operators take two streams and generate a new stream containing all possible combinations of elements from the original streams.

Here's a practical example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/cross.ts

```

It's important to note that the right-hand side stream (`s2` in this case) will be iterated multiple times, once for each element in the left-hand side stream (`s1`). This means that if the right-hand side stream involves expensive or side-effectful operations, they will be executed multiple times.

## Partitioning

Partitioning a stream means dividing it into two separate streams based on a specified condition. The Stream module provides two helpful functions for achieving this: `Stream.partition` and `Stream.partitionEither`. Let's explore how these functions work and when to use them.

### partition

The `Stream.partition` function takes a predicate as input and splits the original stream into two substreams: one containing elements that satisfy the predicate (evaluate to `true`), and the other containing elements that do not (evaluate to `false`). Additionally, these substreams are wrapped within a `Scope` type.

Here's an example where we partition a stream of numbers into even and odd numbers:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/partition.ts

```

In this example, we use the `Stream.partition` function with a predicate to split the stream into even and odd numbers. The `bufferSize` option controls how much the faster stream can advance beyond the slower one.

### partitionEither

Sometimes, you may need to partition a stream using an effectful predicate. For such cases, the `Stream.partitionEither` function is available. This function accepts an effectful predicate and divides the stream into two substreams based on the result of the predicate: elements that yield `Either.left` values go to one substream, while elements yielding `Either.right` values go to the other.

Here's an example where we use `Stream.partitionEither` to partition a stream of numbers based on an effectful condition:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/partitionEither.ts

```

In this case, the `Stream.partitionEither` function splits the stream into two substreams: one containing values that are less than 5 (doubled using `Either.left`), and the other containing values greater than or equal to 5 (using `Either.right`).

## GroupBy

When working with streams of data, you may often need to group elements based on certain criteria. The Stream module provides two functions for achieving this: `groupByKey` and `groupBy`. Let's explore how these functions work and when to use them.

### groupByKey

The `Stream.groupByKey` function allows you to partition a stream by a simple function of type `(a: A) => K`, where `A` represents the type of elements in your stream, and `K` represents the keys by which the stream should be partitioned.
This function is not effectful, it simply groups elements by applying the provided function.

The `Stream.groupByKey` function returns a new data type called `GroupBy`.
This `GroupBy` type represents a grouped stream.
To work with the groups, you can use the `GroupBy.evaluate` function, which takes a function of type `(key: K, stream: Stream<never, E, V>) => Stream.Stream<...>`. This function runs across all groups and merges them in a non-deterministic fashion.

In the example below, we use `groupByKey` to group exam results by the tens place of their scores and count the number of results in each group:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/groupByKey.ts

```

In this example, we partition the exam results into groups based on the tens place of their scores (e.g., 60, 90, 70). The `groupByKey` function is ideal for simple, non-effectful partitioning.

### groupBy

In more complex scenarios where partitioning involves effects, you can turn to the `Stream.groupBy` function. This function takes an effectful partitioning function and generates a `GroupBy` data type, representing a grouped stream. You can then use `GroupBy.evaluate` in a similar fashion as before to process the groups.

In the following example, we group names by their first character and count the number of names in each group. Note that the partitioning operation itself is simulated as effectful:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/groupBy.ts

```

## Grouping

When working with streams, you may encounter situations where you need to group elements in a more structured manner. The Stream module provides two helpful functions for achieving this: `grouped` and `groupedWithin`. In this section, we'll explore how these functions work and when to use them.

### grouped

The `Stream.grouped` function is perfect for partitioning stream results into chunks of a specified size. It's especially useful when you want to work with data in smaller, more manageable pieces.

Here's an example that demonstrates the use of `Stream.grouped`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/grouped.ts

```

In this example, we take a stream of numbers from 0 to 9 and use `Stream.grouped(3)` to divide it into chunks of size 3.

### groupedWithin

The `Stream.groupedWithin` function provides more flexibility by allowing you to group events based on time intervals or chunk size, whichever condition is satisfied first. This is particularly useful when you want to group data based on time constraints.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/groupedWithin.ts

```

In this example, we use `Stream.groupedWithin(18, "1.5 seconds")` to create chunks of data. The grouping operation occurs either when 18 elements are reached or when 1.5 seconds have passed since the last chunk was created. This is particularly useful when dealing with time-sensitive data or when you want to control the chunk size dynamically.

## Concatenation

In stream processing, there are scenarios where you may want to combine the contents of multiple streams. The Stream module provides several operators for achieving this, including `Stream.concat`, `Stream.concatAll`, and `Stream.flatMap`. Let's explore these operators and understand how to use them effectively.

### Simple Concatenation

The `Stream.concat` operator is a straightforward way to concatenate two streams. It returns a new stream that emits elements from the left-hand stream followed by elements from the right-hand stream. This is useful when you want to combine two streams in a sequential manner.

Here's an example of using `Stream.concat`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/concat.ts

```

### Concatenating Multiple Streams

Sometimes you may have multiple streams that you want to concatenate together. Instead of manually chaining `Stream.concat` operations, you can use `Stream.concatAll` to concatenate a `Chunk` of streams.

Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/concatAll.ts

```

### Advanced Concatenation with flatMap

The `Stream.flatMap` operator allows you to create a stream whose elements are generated by applying a function of type `(a: A) => Stream<...>` to each output of the source stream. It concatenates all of the results.

Here's an example of using `Stream.flatMap`:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/flatMap.ts

```

If we need to do the `flatMap` concurrently, we can use the `concurrency` option, and also if the order of concatenation is not important for us, we can use the `switch` option.

## Merging

Sometimes we need to interleave the emission of two streams and create another stream. In these cases, we can't use the `Stream.concat` operation because the concat operation waits for the first stream to finish and then consumes the second stream. So we need a way of picking elements from different sources. Effect Stream's merge operations does this for us. Let's discuss some variants of this operation:

### merge

The `Stream.merge` operation allows us to pick elements from different source streams and merge them into a single stream. Unlike `Stream.concat`, which waits for the first stream to finish before moving to the second, `Stream.merge` interleaves elements from both streams as they become available.

Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/merge.ts

```

### Termination Strategy

When merging two streams, we should consider their termination strategy. Each stream has its own lifetime, some may finish quickly, while others may continue indefinitely. By default, when using `Stream.merge`, the resulting stream terminates only when both specified streams terminate.

However, you can define the termination strategy to align with your requirements. Stream offers four different termination strategies using the `haltStrategy` option:

- `"left"`. The resulting stream will terminate when the left-hand side stream terminates.
- `"right"`. The resulting stream will terminate when the right-hand side stream finishes.
- `"both"`. The resulting stream will terminate when both streams finish.
- `"either"`. The resulting stream will terminate when one of the streams finishes.

Here's an example of specifying a termination strategy:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/merge-haltStrategy.ts

```

In this example, we use `haltStrategy: "left"` to make the resulting stream terminate when the left-hand stream (`s1`) finishes.

### mergeWith

In some cases, we not only want to merge two streams but also transform and unify their elements into new types. This is where `Stream.mergeWith` comes into play. It allows us to specify transformation functions for both source streams.

Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/mergeWith.ts

```

In this example, we use `Stream.mergeWith` to merge `s1` and `s2` while converting string elements from `s1` to integers and rounding decimal elements from `s2`.

## Interleaving

The `Stream.interleave` operator allows us to pull one element at a time from each of two streams, creating a new interleaved stream. Once one of the streams is exhausted, the remaining values from the other stream are pulled.

Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/interleave.ts

```

For more advanced interleaving logic, `Stream.interleaveWith` provides additional flexibility. It allows you to specify the interleaving logic using a third stream of `boolean` values. When the boolean stream emits `true`, it chooses elements from the left-hand stream; otherwise, it selects elements from the right-hand stream.

Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/interleaveWith.ts

```

In this example, `booleanStream` decides which source stream to choose for interleaving. When `true`, it picks elements from `s1`, and when `false`, it selects elements from `s2`.

## Interspersing

Interspersing is a technique that allows you to add separators in a stream. This can be especially useful when you want to format or structure the data in your streams.

### intersperse

The `Stream.intersperse` operator lets you intersperse a delimiter element between the elements of a stream. This delimiter can be any value you choose. It's added between each pair of elements in the original stream.

Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/intersperse.ts

```

In this example, we have a stream `stream` with numbers from 1 to 5, and we use `Stream.intersperse(0)` to add zeros between them.

### intersperseAffixes

For more advanced interspersing needs, `Stream.intersperseAffixes` provides greater control. It allows you to specify different affixes for the start, middle, and end of your stream. These affixes can be strings or any other values you want.

Here's an example:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/intersperseAffixes.ts

```

In this example, we use `Stream.intersperseAffixes` to enclose the numbers from 1 to 5 within square brackets, separating them with hyphens.

## Broadcasting

Broadcasting a stream is a way to create multiple streams that contain the same elements as the source stream. This operation allows you to send each element to multiple downstream streams simultaneously. However, the upstream stream can emit events only up to a certain limit, which is determined by the `maximumLag` parameter. Once this limit is reached, the upstream stream slows down to match the speed of the slowest downstream stream.

Let's take a closer look at how broadcasting works in the following example. Here, we are broadcasting a stream of numbers to two downstream streams. One of them calculates the maximum number in the stream, while the other performs some logging with an additional delay. The upstream stream adjusts its speed based on the slower logging stream:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/broadcast.ts

```

## Buffering

Effect streams operate in a pull-based manner, which means downstream consumers can request elements at their own pace without needing to signal the upstream to slow down. However, there are scenarios where you might need to handle producers and consumers independently, especially when there's a speed mismatch between them. This is where buffering comes into play, allowing you to manage communication between a faster producer and a slower consumer effectively. Effect streams provide a built-in `Stream.buffer` operator to assist with this.

### buffer

The `Stream.buffer` operator is designed to facilitate scenarios where a faster producer needs to work independently of a slower consumer. It achieves this by buffering elements in a queue, allowing the producer to continue working even if the consumer lags behind. You can specify the maximum buffer capacity using the `capacity` option.

Let's walk through an example to see how it works:

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/buffer.ts

```

In this example, we create a stream of numbers from 1 to 11. We use `Stream.buffer({ capacity: 4 })` to buffer up to 4 elements at a time. As you can see, the `Stream.tap` operator allows us to log each element before and after buffering. We've also introduced a 5-second delay between each emission to illustrate the lag between producing and consuming messages.

You can choose from different buffering options based on the type of underlying queue you need:

- Bounded Queue: `{ capacity: number }`
- Unbounded Queue: `{ capacity: "unbounded" }`
- Sliding Queue: `{ capacity: number, strategy: "sliding" }`
- Dropping Queue: `{ capacity: number, strategy: "dropping" }`

## Debouncing

The `Stream.debounce` function plays a crucial role in controlling the rate at which elements are emitted. It introduces a minimum time interval between the emission of each element. This ensures that elements are emitted at a more controlled pace, especially when dealing with rapid or frequent emissions.

```ts file=<rootDir>/src/streaming/stream/operations/debounce.ts

```

In this example, we have a stream that emits elements at varying intervals. Some elements are emitted rapidly, while others are separated by pauses of different durations. We apply debouncing with a minimum pause requirement of 100 milliseconds using `Stream.debounce("100 millis")`.

The result is that only elements that follow a pause of at least 100 milliseconds are emitted. This means that elements 1, 2, 4, and 5 are effectively skipped because they are emitted too close together. Only elements 3 and 6, which have a pause of at least 100 milliseconds before them, are emitted.
