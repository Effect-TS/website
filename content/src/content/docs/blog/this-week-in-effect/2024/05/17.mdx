Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to a **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**), our weekly update that aims to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

## Overview of TWIE

If you're new to TWIE, here are a few words on what TWIE is and what it aims for.

We’re happy to see the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect. At the same time, we understand that it might not be easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Effect became API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- Our community on Discord reached **2790+ members**!
- We're publishing new Effect Days talks every week. Make sure you don't miss any by subscribing to the [Effect YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts).
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates**!

We want to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey and actively engage with the community!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content, etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

Now, back to business!

### Content update

On Monday, we released a new talk from the Effect Days Conference, 'Effective State Machines for Complex Logic' by David Khourshid. In this talk, David discusses the use of state machines and the Effect library for managing complex logic in applications. He explains how state machines help to clarify edge cases and use cases, and how the Effect library can be used to declaratively represent effects within state machines.
