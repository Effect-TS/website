When we write programs, it is common to need to keep track of some form of state during the execution of the program. State refers to any data that can change as the program runs. For example, in a counter application, the count value changes as the user increments or decrements it. Similarly, in a banking application, the account balance changes as deposits and withdrawals are made. State management is crucial to building interactive and dynamic applications.

In traditional imperative programming, one common way to store state is using variables. However, this approach can introduce bugs, especially when the state is shared between multiple components or functions. As the program becomes more complex, managing shared state can become challenging.

To overcome these issues, Effect introduces a powerful data type called `Ref`, which represents a mutable reference. With `Ref`, we can share state between different parts of our program without relying on mutable variables directly. Instead, `Ref` provides a controlled way to handle mutable state and safely update it in a concurrent environment.

Effect's `Ref` data type enables communication between different fibers in your program. This capability is crucial in concurrent programming, where multiple tasks may need to access and update shared state simultaneously.

In this guide, we will explore how to use the `Ref` data type to manage state in your programs effectively. We will cover simple examples like counting, as well as more complex scenarios where state is shared between different parts of the program. Additionally, we will show how to use `Ref` in a concurrent environment, allowing multiple tasks to interact with shared state safely.

Let's dive in and see how we can leverage `Ref` for effective state management in your Effect programs.

## Using Ref

Let's explore how to use the `Ref` data type with a simple example of a counter:

```twoslash include Counter
import { Effect, Ref } from "effect"

export class Counter {
  inc: Effect.Effect<never, never, void>
  dec: Effect.Effect<never, never, void>
  get: Effect.Effect<never, never, number>

  constructor(private value: Ref.Ref<number>) {
    this.inc = Ref.update(this.value, (n) => n + 1)
    this.dec = Ref.update(this.value, (n) => n - 1)
    this.get = Ref.get(this.value)
  }
}

export const make = Effect.map(Ref.make(0), (value) => new Counter(value))
```

```ts filename="Counter.ts" twoslash
// @include: Counter
```

Here is the usage example of the `Counter`:

<Tabs items={["Using Effect.gen", "Using pipe"]}>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Counter.ts
// @include: Counter

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Effect } from "effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

const program = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const counter = yield* _(Counter.make)
  yield* _(counter.inc)
  yield* _(counter.inc)
  yield* _(counter.dec)
  yield* _(counter.inc)
  const value = yield* _(counter.get)
  console.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`)
})

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
This counter has a value of 2.
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Counter.ts
// @include: Counter

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Effect, Console } from "effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

const program = Counter.make.pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((counter) =>
    counter.inc.pipe(
      Effect.flatMap(() => counter.inc),
      Effect.flatMap(() => counter.dec),
      Effect.flatMap(() => counter.inc),
      Effect.flatMap(() => counter.get),
      Effect.flatMap((value) =>
        Console.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`)
      )
    )
  )
)

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
This counter has a value of 2.
*/
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

<Info>
  All the operations on the `Ref` data type are effectful. So when we are
  reading from or writing to a `Ref`, we are performing an effectful
  operation.
</Info>

## Using Ref in a Concurrent Environment

We can use this counter in a concurrent environment, such as counting the number of requests in a RESTful API.
For this example, let's update the counter concurrently:

<Tabs items={["Using Effect.gen", "Using pipe"]}>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Counter.ts
// @include: Counter

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Effect } from "effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

const program = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const counter = yield* _(Counter.make)

  const logCounter = <R, E, A>(
    label: string,
    effect: Effect.Effect<R, E, A>
  ) =>
    Effect.gen(function* (_) {
      const value = yield* _(counter.get)
      yield* _(Effect.log(`${label} get: ${value}`))
      return yield* _(effect)
    })

  yield* _(
    logCounter("task 1", counter.inc).pipe(
      Effect.zip(logCounter("task 2", counter.inc), { concurrent: true }),
      Effect.zip(logCounter("task 3", counter.dec), { concurrent: true }),
      Effect.zip(logCounter("task 4", counter.inc), { concurrent: true })
    )
  )
  const value = yield* _(counter.get)
  yield* _(Effect.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`))
})

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
... fiber=#2 message="task 4 get: 0"
... fiber=#4 message="task 3 get: 1"
... fiber=#5 message="task 1 get: 0"
... fiber=#5 message="task 2 get: 1"
... fiber=#0 message="This counter has a value of 2."
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
// @filename: Counter.ts
// @include: Counter

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Effect } from "effect"
import * as Counter from "./Counter"

const program = Counter.make.pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((counter) => {
    const logCounter = <R, E, A>(
      label: string,
      effect: Effect.Effect<R, E, A>
    ) =>
      counter.get.pipe(
        Effect.flatMap((value) => Effect.log(`${label} get: ${value}`)),
        Effect.flatMap(() => effect)
      )

    return logCounter("task 1", counter.inc).pipe(
      Effect.zip(logCounter("task 2", counter.inc), { concurrent: true }),
      Effect.zip(logCounter("task 3", counter.dec), { concurrent: true }),
      Effect.zip(logCounter("task 4", counter.inc), { concurrent: true }),
      Effect.flatMap(() => counter.get),
      Effect.flatMap((value) =>
        Effect.log(`This counter has a value of ${value}.`)
      )
    )
  })
)

Effect.runPromise(program)
/*
Output:
... fiber=#2 message="task 4 get: 0"
... fiber=#4 message="task 3 get: 1"
... fiber=#5 message="task 1 get: 0"
... fiber=#5 message="task 2 get: 1"
... fiber=#0 message="This counter has a value of 2."
*/
```

## Using Ref as a Service

You can also pass a `Ref` as a [service](../context-management/services) to share state between different parts of your program. Let's see how this works:

<Tabs items={["Using Effect.gen", "Using pipe"]}>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context, Ref } from "effect"

// Define a custom type for our state
interface MyState extends Ref.Ref<number> {}

// Create a Tag for our state
const MyState = Context.Tag<MyState>()

// Subprogram 1: Increment the state value twice
const subprogram1 = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const state = yield* _(MyState)
  yield* _(Ref.update(state, (n) => n + 1))
  yield* _(Ref.update(state, (n) => n + 1))
})

// Subprogram 2: Decrement the state value and then increment it
const subprogram2 = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const state = yield* _(MyState)
  yield* _(Ref.update(state, (n) => n - 1))
  yield* _(Ref.update(state, (n) => n + 1))
})

// Subprogram 3: Read and log the current value of the state
const subprogram3 = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const state = yield* _(MyState)
  const value = yield* _(Ref.get(state))
  console.log(`MyState has a value of ${value}.`)
})

// Compose subprograms 1, 2, and 3 to create the main program
const program = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  yield* _(subprogram1)
  yield* _(subprogram2)
  yield* _(subprogram3)
})

// Create a Ref instance with an initial value of 0
const initialState = Ref.make(0)

// Provide the Ref as a service
const runnable = Effect.provideServiceEffect(program, MyState, initialState)

// Run the program and observe the output
Effect.runPromise(runnable)
/*
Output:
MyState has a value of 2.
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Context, Ref, Console } from "effect"

// Define a custom type for our state
interface MyState extends Ref.Ref<number> {}

// Create a Tag for our state
const MyState = Context.Tag<MyState>()

// Subprogram 1: Increment the state value twice
const subprogram1 = MyState.pipe(
  Effect.tap((state) => Ref.update(state, (n) => n + 1)),
  Effect.flatMap((state) => Ref.update(state, (n) => n + 1))
)

// Subprogram 2: Decrement the state value and then increment it
const subprogram2 = MyState.pipe(
  Effect.tap((state) => Ref.update(state, (n) => n - 1)),
  Effect.flatMap((state) => Ref.update(state, (n) => n + 1))
)

// Subprogram 3: Read and log the current value of the state
const subprogram3 = MyState.pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((state) => Ref.get(state)),
  Effect.flatMap((value) => Console.log(`MyState has a value of ${value}.`))
)

// Compose subprograms 1, 2, and 3 to create the main program
const program = subprogram1.pipe(
  Effect.flatMap(() => subprogram2),
  Effect.flatMap(() => subprogram3)
)

// Create a Ref instance with an initial value of 0
const initialState = Ref.make(0)

// Provide the Ref as a service
const runnable = Effect.provideServiceEffect(program, MyState, initialState)

// Run the program and observe the output
Effect.runPromise(runnable)
/*
Output:
MyState has a value of 2.
*/
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Note that we use `Effect.provideServiceEffect` instead of `Effect.provideService` to provide an actual implementation of the `MyState` service because all the operations on the `Ref` data type are effectful, including the creation `Ref.make(0)`.

## Sharing state between Fibers

Let's consider an example where we want to read names from user input until the user enters the command `"q"` to exit.

First, let's introduce a `readLine` utility to read user input (ensure you have `@types/node` installed):

```twoslash include ReadLine
// @types: node
import { Effect } from "effect"
import * as NodeReadLine from "node:readline"

export const readLine = (
  message: string
): Effect.Effect<never, never, string> =>
  Effect.promise(
    () =>
      new Promise((resolve) => {
        const rl = NodeReadLine.createInterface({
          input: process.stdin,
          output: process.stdout
        })
        rl.question(message, (answer) => {
          rl.close()
          resolve(answer)
        })
      })
  )
```

```ts filename="ReadLine.ts" twoslash
// @include: ReadLine
```

Now, let's take a look at the main program:

<Tabs items={["Using Effect.gen", "Using pipe"]}>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
// @filename: ReadLine.ts
// @include: ReadLine

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Effect, Chunk, Ref } from "effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"

const getNames = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const ref = yield* _(Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>()))
  while (true) {
    const name = yield* _(
      ReadLine.readLine("Please enter a name or `q` to exit: ")
    )
    if (name === "q") {
      break
    }
    yield* _(Ref.update(ref, (state) => Chunk.append(state, name)))
  }
  return yield* _(Ref.get(ref))
})

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ "Alice", "Bob" ]
}
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
// @filename: ReadLine.ts
// @include: ReadLine

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Effect, Chunk, Ref } from "effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"

const getNames = Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>()).pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((ref) =>
    ReadLine.readLine("Please enter a name or `q` to exit: ").pipe(
      Effect.repeat({
        while: (name) => {
          if (name === "q") {
            return Effect.succeed(false)
          } else {
            return ref.pipe(
              Ref.update((state) => Chunk.append(state, name)),
              Effect.as(true)
            )
          }
        }
      }),
      Effect.flatMap(() => Ref.get(ref))
    )
  )
)

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ "Alice", "Bob" ]
}
*/
```

</Tab>
</Tabs>

Now that we have learned how to use the `Ref` data type, we can use it to manage the state concurrently. For example, assume while we are reading from the console, we have another fiber that is trying to update the state from a different source:

<Tabs items={["Using Effect.gen", "Using pipe"]}>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
// @filename: ReadLine.ts
// @include: ReadLine

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Effect, Chunk, Ref, Fiber } from "effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"

const getNames = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const ref = yield* _(Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>()))
  const fiber1 = yield* _(
    Effect.fork(
      Effect.gen(function* (_) {
        while (true) {
          const name = yield* _(
            ReadLine.readLine("Please enter a name or `q` to exit: ")
          )
          if (name === "q") {
            break
          }
          yield* _(Ref.update(ref, (state) => Chunk.append(state, name)))
        }
      })
    )
  )
  const fiber2 = yield* _(
    Effect.fork(
      Effect.gen(function* (_) {
        for (const name of ["John", "Jane", "Joe", "Tom"]) {
          yield* _(Ref.update(ref, (state) => Chunk.append(state, name)))
          yield* _(Effect.sleep("1 seconds"))
        }
      })
    )
  )
  yield* _(Fiber.join(fiber1))
  yield* _(Fiber.join(fiber2))
  return yield* _(Ref.get(ref))
})

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ ... ]
}
*/
```

</Tab>
<Tab>

```ts twoslash
// @filename: ReadLine.ts
// @include: ReadLine

// @filename: index.ts
// ---cut---
import { Effect, Chunk, Ref, Fiber } from "effect"
import * as ReadLine from "./ReadLine"

const getNames = Ref.make(Chunk.empty<string>()).pipe(
  Effect.flatMap((ref) => {
    const fiber1 = ReadLine.readLine(
      "Please enter a name or `q` to exit: "
    ).pipe(
      Effect.repeat({
        while: (name) => {
          if (name === "q") {
            return Effect.succeed(false)
          } else {
            return ref.pipe(
              Ref.update((state) => Chunk.append(state, name)),
              Effect.as(true)
            )
          }
        }
      }),
      Effect.fork
    )
    const fiber2 = Effect.fork(
      Effect.forEach(
        ["John", "Jane", "Joe", "Tom"],
        (name) =>
          ref.pipe(
            Ref.update((state) => Chunk.append(state, name)),
            Effect.flatMap(() => Effect.sleep("1 seconds"))
          ),
        { concurrency: "unbounded", discard: true }
      )
    )
    return Effect.all([fiber1, fiber2]).pipe(
      Effect.flatMap(([f1, f2]) =>
        Fiber.join(f1).pipe(Effect.flatMap(() => Fiber.join(f2)))
      ),
      Effect.flatMap(() => Ref.get(ref))
    )
  })
)

Effect.runPromise(getNames).then(console.log)
/*
Output:
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Alice
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: Bob
Please enter a name or `q` to exit: q
{
  _id: "Chunk",
  values: [ ... ]
}
*/
```
