Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Recent major updates:

- The [Effect Days](https://effect.website/events/effect-days) conference is returning this March 2025! 🎉
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 3740+ members!
- [Effect 3.12](https://effect.website/blog/releases/effect/312) has been released.

## Community highlights

- [Tylor Steinberger](https://github.com/TylorS) had a productive holiday and built some useful tools for the community:
   - a [type-safe templating library for TypeScript](https://github.com/TylorS/templeffect), based on Effect Schema, that provides a seamless way to create and compose templates with built-in parameter validation, template nesting, and automatic type inference;
   - a [TypeScript library providing common ID format generation](https://github.com/TylorS/typed-id) using Effect. This package includes implementations for UUID, NanoID, and ULID generation with a focus on type safety and functional programming principles;
   - a [type-safe reactive state management library for Effect](https://github.com/TylorS/typed-lazy-ref), combining the best of lazy evaluation and reactive programming. This library provides a way to manage state that is both efficient (computed only when needed) and reactive (automatically updates dependents when changes occur);
   - a [type-safe, Effect-based library for managing asynchronous data states in TypeScript applications](https://github.com/TylorS/typed-async-data). Built on top of the Effect ecosystem, it provides a composable way to handle loading, success, failure, and optimistic states of your data;
   - an [Effect-based library for managing browser navigation](https://github.com/TylorS/typed-navigation). Built on top of the Navigation API where supported, falling back to the History API, it provides a type-safe and composable way to handle routing, history management, and navigation events in your web applications.

- Ray made a new debug panel to view the Effect Metric, Worker, Sqlite WASM related data. Code available here: [effect-metrics-view](https://codesandbox.io/p/sandbox/effect-metrics-view-8xxsvx?file=%2Fsrc%2FApp.js).
