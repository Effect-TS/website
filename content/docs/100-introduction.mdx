| **Error Handling**  | Handle errors in a structured and reliable manner using Effect's built-in error handling capabilities.             |
| **Asynchronicity**  | Write code that looks the same, whether it is synchronous or asynchronous.                                         |
| **Observability**   | With full tracing capabilities, you can easily debug and monitor the execution of your Effect program.             |

## How to Use These Docs

The documentation is structured in a sequential manner, starting from the basics and progressing to more advanced topics.
