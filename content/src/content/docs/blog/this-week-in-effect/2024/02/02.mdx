import Tweet from "astro-tweet"

Hi Effecters! Welcome to the very first **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**).

We’re proud to present you with this new format created to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

## Overview of TWIE

Before we get into what happened in the last week in our Community, we would like to say a few words about TWIE.

We’re happy to witness the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect, and we understand that it might not be that easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Our Discord server **reached 1850+ members** a few days ago and the engagement is at an all-time high.
- We’re approaching our very first **[Effect Days Conference](/events/effect-days/)** in Vienna on February 23, 2024, and lots of new content is coming up.
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates** and there has been a lot of activity on GitHub.

So, we wanted to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

In this way, we want to help you stay on track with everything happening in the Effect Ecosystem and actively engage with our community.

So, let’s start!

## Technology

Lists all the features, bug fixes, and changes (sometimes breaking) of this week.

### General Chores

- [Add provenance publishing](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2019)

This adds [provenance](https://docs.npmjs.com/generating-provenance-statements) for publishing packages.

### Effect Core

- [Document intoDeferred](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2004)

Add JSDoc documentation for `Effect.intoDeferred`

- [Optimizes FiberId hashing](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2007)

Improves performance of computing a FiberId hash by caching the computation

- [Use TimeoutException for timeout](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/1995) (Breaking)

Use `TimeoutException` for timeout, previously timeout used `NoSuchElementException` and it proved to be confusing and error-prone when using combinators such as `Effect.optionFromOptional` to recover from such exceptions.

The following code is now valid:

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

const recoverFromTimeout = Effect.sleep("2 seconds").pipe(
  Effect.timeout("1 second"),
  Effect.catchTag("TimeoutException", () =>
    Effect.log("The program timed out")
  )
)
```

- [Make Equal & Hash Implicit](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2023) (Breaking)

With this change we remove the `Data` type and we make `Equal` & `Hash` implicit traits.

The main reason is that `Data<A>` was structurally equivalent to `A & Equal` but extending `Equal` doesn't mean that the equality is implemented by-value, so the type was simply adding noise without gaining any level of safety.

The module `Data` remains unchanged at the value level, all the functions previously available are supposed to work in exactly the same manner.

At the type level instead the functions return `Readonly` variants, so for example we have:

```ts
import { Data } from "effect"

const obj = Data.struct({
  a: 0,
  b: 1
})
```

will have the `obj` typed as:

```ts
declare const obj: {
  readonly a: number
  readonly b: number
}
```

- [Improve naming for ReadonlyRecord](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2024) (Breaking)

Improves naming of methods within the `ReadonlyRecord` module. Specifically, it renames `ReadonlyRecord.upsert` to `ReadonlyRecord.set` and `ReadonlyRecord.update` to `ReadonlyRecord.replace`. It also adds a new `ReadonlyRecord.modify` combinator that can be used to apply a function to the value of a `ReadonlyRecord` at a specific key.

### Effect Schema

- [Add annotations to README](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/1996)

Adds a new section to the project README that explains the annotations feature by showing how to customize the generation of `Arbitrary<A>` instances.

- [Reorganizes overloads in Schema.optional](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2005)

Reorganizes overloads in `Schema.optional` to improve development experience when specifying defaults.

- [Fix Equivalence with Transformations](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2017)

Improves generation of `Equivalence` supporting cases where schemas include transformations. Namely the following code:

```ts
import { Schema } from "@effect/schema"

const schema = S.NumberFromString
const equivalence = E.make(schema)
```

No longer throws an error.

- [Add option to preserve excess properties](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2011)

Add `option` to preserve excess properties when parsing, the feature is described in detail in [the issue](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/issues/2008) and can be summarized as:

```ts
const data = S.parseSync({
  foo: S.string
})({
  foo: "ok",
  bar: "ok"
})
```

The above code will strip the `bar` property as it is not defined in the schema, with the additional option as below:

```ts
const data = S.parseSync({
  foo: S.string
})(
  {
    foo: "ok",
    bar: "ok"
  },
  {
    onExcessProperty: "preserve"
  }
)
```

The excess property is no longer removed.

- [Reorder Schema Generics](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2026) (Breaking)

Swaps the order of type parameters to simplify explicit type definitions, namely `Schema<R, I, A>` becomes `Schema<A, I = A, R = never>` this change also enables us to specify defaults for type parameters.

This enables to type simple schemas as:

```ts
import { Schema } from "@effect/schema"

declare const number: Schema<number>
```

and most importantly enables to ignore context when not needed like:

```ts
import { Schema } from "@effect/schema"

declare const numberFromString: Schema<number, string>
```

instead of being forced to write every parameter always like:

```ts
import { Schema } from "@effect/schema"

declare const number: Schema<never, number, number>
```

### Effect Platform

- [Ensure forked fibers are interruptible](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/1999)

Ensuring that fibers forked in uninterruptible regions are able to be interrupted.

- [Use Proxy for Transferable](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2020)

Use `Proxy` for platform schema `Transferable`.

- [Support URL objects in Http Client](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2016)

Adds support for URL objects in HTTP Client, the following code is now valid:

```ts
import { HttpClientRequest, HttpClient } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const request = HttpClientRequest.get(
  new URL("https://www.google.com/")
).pipe(
  HttpClient.fetchOk,
  Effect.flatMap((_) => _.text)
)
```

- [Remove re-exports and rename packages](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2025) (Breaking)

Removes re-exports from `@effect/platform-*` packages and improves naming of specialized modules, generic modules like `HttpClient` can now be imported only from `@effect/platform` and specific modules like `NodeRuntime` can be imported from the specific platform package (in this case `@effect/platform-node`).

```ts
import { Runtime } from "@effect/platform-node"
```

becomes:

```ts
import { NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
```

and:

```ts
import { HttpClient } from "@effect/platform-node"
```

becomes:

```ts
import { HttpClient } from "@effect/platform"
```

- [Fixes encoding of Transferable](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2027) (Breaking)

Fixes encoding of Transferable schemas, breaking because it includes a type-level change.

### Effect Experimental

- [Ensure forked fibers are interruptible](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/1999)

Ensuring that fibers forked in uninterruptible regions are able to be interrupted.

### Effect CLI

- [Fix error reporting for single input](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2001)

Ensures proper error reporting when a single input is provided to a variadic option. Prior, the check was silently skipped.

- [Update README](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/pull/2003)

Fixes the README to update:

- introduction of the executable parameter as CLI no longer needs to slice `process.argv` and automatically deals with executable path;
- adds missing `Args` from the README example.
