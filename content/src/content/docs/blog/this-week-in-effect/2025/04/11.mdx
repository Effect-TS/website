Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you‚Äôll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Recent major updates:

- We started publishing the [talks from Effect Days 2025](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLDf3uQLaK2B9bEBZbwMv04e_zSbRNPKH6)! 
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 4040+ members!
