Effect comes equipped with five pre-built services:

```ts
type DefaultServices = Clock | Console | Random | ConfigProvider | Tracer
```

When we employ these services, there's no need to explicitly provide their implementations. Effect automatically supplies live versions of these services to our effects, sparing us from manual setup.

```ts twoslash
import { Effect, Clock, Console } from "effect"

const program = Effect.gen(function* (_) {
  const now = yield* _(Clock.currentTimeMillis)
  yield* _(Console.log(`Application started at ${new Date(now)}`))
})
```

As you can observe, even if our program utilizes both `Clock` and `Console`, the `R` parameter, representing the contextual data required for the effect to execute, remains set to `never`.

```ts
Effect<void, never, never>
```

Effect takes care of handling these services seamlessly for us.
