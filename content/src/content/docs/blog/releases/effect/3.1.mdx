Effect 3.1.0 has been released! This release includes a number of new features and improvements. Here's a summary of what's new:

### Stream.fromEventListener

This new api allows you to create a `Stream` from an `EventTarget`:

```ts
import { Stream } from "effect/Stream"

Stream.fromEventListener(window, "click")
```

`@effect/platform-browser/BrowserStream` has also been added, with `fromEventListenerWindow` & `fromEventListenerDocument` apis.

### Effect.timeoutOption

A new timeout api has been added, which returns the result of the wrapped Effect as an `Option`.

If the wrapped Effect times out, a `Option.None` is returned - otherwise the result is wrapped with `Option.Some`.

### "kind" field has been added to spans

Tracing spans now include a `kind` field, which is used to indicate the type of system that generated the span.

For example, `@effect/platform/HttpServer` will generate spans with a `kind` of `server`. While `@effect/platform/HttpClient` will generate spans with a `kind` of `client`.

### @effect/platform/Http/Multipart schema changes

- `Http.multipart.filesSchema` has been renamed to `Http.multipart.FilesSchema`
- `Http.multipart.FileSchema` is now exported
- `Http.multipart.SingleFileSchema` has been added

### Effect.annotateLogsScoped

A new api has been added to `Effect` which allows you to annotate logs during the lifetime of a Scope.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.gen(function* () {
  yield* Effect.log("no annotations")
  yield* Effect.annotateLogsScoped({ foo: "bar" })
  yield* Effect.log("annotated with foo=bar")
}).pipe(Effect.scoped, Effect.andThen(Effect.log("no annotations again")))
```

### Data.TaggedEnum helpers

`$is` & `$match` helpers have been added to `Data.TaggedEnum` constructors.

```ts
import { Data } from "effect"

type HttpError = Data.TaggedEnum<{
  NotFound: {}
  InternalServerError: { reason: string }
}>
const { $is, $match, InternalServerError, NotFound } =
  Data.taggedEnum<HttpError>()

// create a matcher
const matcher = $match({
  NotFound: () => 0,
  InternalServerError: () => 1
})

// use the guard
$is("NotFound")(NotFound()) // true
$is("NotFound")(InternalServerError({ reason: "fail" })) // false
```

### Types.DeepMutable

A type helper has been added, which transforms a type into a deeply mutable version.

```ts
import { Types } from "effect"

type Values<A> = {
  readonly _tag: string
  readonly value: ReadonlyArray<A>
}

// { _tag: string, value: Array<A> }
type MutableValues<A> = Types.DeepMutable<Values<A>>
```

### New SortedMap APIs

- `SortedMap.lastOption` has been added
- `SortedMap.partition` has been added
