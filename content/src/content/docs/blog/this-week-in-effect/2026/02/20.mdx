Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers build complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)


**Recent major updates:**


- **[Effect v4 Beta](https://effect.website/blog/releases/effect/40-beta/) Release!**
- [Effect AI SDK](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/releases/tag/%40effect%2Fai%400.27.0) Release.
- Durable workflows in TypeScript with [`@effect/workflow`](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/workflow/README.md) - currently in alpha.
- 6100+ community members on [Discord](https://discord.gg/effect-ts).
- 13k 🌟 stars on [GitHub](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect).

## Technology

[**Effect v4 Beta**](https://effect.website/blog/releases/effect/40-beta/) is officially live! Here are the key highlights:

- **Rewritten runtime** with lower memory overhead, faster execution, and simpler internals. Bundle sizes have dropped dramatically — a minimal program combining Effect, Stream, and Schema went from ~70 kB in v3 to ~20 kB in v4.
- **Unified versioning** across all ecosystem packages, eliminating version mismatch confusion.
- **Consolidated architecture** — many previously separate packages (`@effect/platform`, `@effect/rpc`, `@effect/cluster`) have been merged into the core `effect` package.
- **Unstable modules** via `effect/unstable/*` import paths, enabling faster iteration on emerging APIs before they graduate to stable status.
- **v3 compatibility** — the core programming model remains unchanged, and Effect v3 will continue receiving maintenance alongside v4.
