A `HashSet` represents an _un-ordered_, _collection_ of _unique_ values with efficient lookup, insertion and removal operations.
The Effect library provides two variants of this data structure:

1. [**`HashSet<A>`**](/docs/data-types/hash-set/#hashset-details) - An immutable set implementation
2. [**`MutableHashSet<A>`**](/docs/data-types/hash-set/#mutablehashset-details) - A mutable set implementation

Both implementations store unique values and provide O(1) average-time complexity for core operations, but they differ in how modifications are handled.


## What problem does HashSet solve?

HashSet solves the problem of maintaining an **unsorted collection where each value appears exactly once**, with fast operations for checking membership and adding/removing values.

Some common use cases include:
- Tracking unique items (e.g., users who have completed an action)
- Efficiently testing for membership in a collection
- Performing set operations like union, intersection, and difference
- Eliminating duplicates from a collection

## When to use `HashSet` Instead of other "collections"

Choose HashSet (either variant) over other collections when:

- You need to ensure elements are unique
- You frequently need to check if an element exists in the collection
- You need to perform set operations like union, intersection, and difference
- The order of elements doesn't matter to your use case

Choose other collections when:
- You need to maintain insertion order (use `List` or `Array`)
- You need key-value associations (use `HashMap` or `MutableHashMap`)
- You need to frequently access elements by index (use `Array`)

## Choosing between _immutable_ and _mutable_ variants

The Effect library provides two implementations to accommodate different programming styles and performance needs:

### Immutable `HashSet<A>`

The immutable `HashSet` follows functional programming principles where data structures are never modified in place. Instead, operations that would change the set return a new instance with the changes applied, leaving the original set unchanged.

**Characteristics:**
- Operations return new instances instead of modifying the original
- Previous states are preserved
- Thread-safe by design
- Ideal for functional programming patterns
- Suitable for sharing across different parts of your application

### `MutableHashSet<A>`

The mutable `MutableHashSet` allows direct modification of the underlying collection. Operations like add and remove change the set in place rather than creating new instances.

**Characteristics:**
- Operations modify the original set directly
- More efficient when building sets incrementally
- Requires careful handling to avoid unexpected side effects
- Better performance in scenarios with many modifications
- Ideal for localized use where mutations won't cause issues elsewhere


### When to use each variant

#### Use immutable `HashSet` when:

- You need predictable behavior with no side effects
- You want to preserve previous states of your data
- You're sharing sets across different parts of your application
- You prefer functional programming patterns
- You need fiber safety in concurrent environments

#### Use `MutableHashSet` when:

- Performance is critical, and you need to avoid creating new instances
- You're building a collection incrementally with many additions/removals
- You're working in a controlled scope where mutation is safe
- You need to optimize memory usage in performance-critical code

#### Hybrid approach:
Another option is to use the **bounded mutation context** provided by the immutable `HashSet`:

```ts twoslash
import { HashSet } from "effect"

// Start with an immutable set
const original = HashSet.make(1, 2, 3)

// Use the mutation API for a series of changes
const modified = HashSet.mutate(original, (draft) => {
	// this is bounded mutation context!
  HashSet.add(draft, 4)
  HashSet.add(draft, 5)
  HashSet.remove(draft, 1)
})

console.log(HashSet.toValues(original)) // [1, 2, 3] - original unchanged
console.log(HashSet.toValues(modified)) // [2, 3, 4, 5] - new version with changes
```

## Performance characteristics

Both HashSet variants provide similar time performance characteristics for their core operations:

| Operation      | `HashSet`    | `MutableHashSet` | Description                           |
|----------------|--------------|------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Lookup         | O(1) average | O(1) average     | Checking if an element exists         |
| Insertion      | O(1) average | O(1) average     | Adding a new element                  |
| Removal        | O(1) average | O(1) average     | Removing an existing element          |
| Iteration      | O(n)         | O(n)             | Traversing all elements               |
| Set operations | O(n)         | O(n)             | Union, intersection, difference, etc. |


The primary performance difference lies in how modifications are handled:

- **Immutable HashSet** creates new instances for every modification, which can impact performance when making many sequential changes.
- **MutableHashSet** modifies the existing structure, making it more efficient for multiple sequential modifications.

## Equality and uniqueness

Both HashSet variants use Effect's [`Equal`](/docs/trait/equal/#_top) trait to determine when elements are the same, ensuring that each element appears exactly once in the set. This applies to:

- **Primitive Values:** Equality is determined by value (similar to the `===` operator).
- **Objects and Custom Types:** For objects and other custom types, equality is determined by whether those types implement the `Equal` interface themselves.
	If an element type implements `Equal`, the `HashSet` will delegate to that implementation to perform the equality check. This allows you to define custom logic for determining when two instances of your objects should be considered equal based on their properties, rather than just their object identity. The fallback strategy is equality by reference.


```ts twoslash
import { Equal, Hash, HashSet } from "effect"

class Person implements Equal.Equal {
  constructor(
    readonly id: number, // Unique identifier
    readonly name: string,
    readonly age: number
  ) { }

  // Define equality based on id, name, and age
  [Equal.symbol](that: Equal.Equal): boolean {
    if (that instanceof Person) {
      return Equal.equals(this.id, that.id) && Equal.equals(this.name, that.name) && Equal.equals(this.age, that.age)
    }
    return false
  }

  // Generate a hash code based on the unique id
  [Hash.symbol](): number {
    return Hash.hash(this.id)
  }
}

// Creating a HashSet with objects that implement the Equal interface
const set = HashSet.empty().pipe(
  HashSet.add(new Person(1, "Alice", 30)),
  HashSet.add(new Person(1, "Alice", 30))
)

// HashSet recognizes them as equal, so only one element is stored
console.log(HashSet.size(set))
// Output: 1
```

**Simplifying Equality and Hashing with `Data` and `Schema`:**

Using Effect's [`Data`](/docs/data-types/data/) or [`Schema.Data`](/docs/schema/effect-data-types/#interop-with-data) modules can automatically implement the necessary `Equal` trait for your custom types:

```ts twoslash
import { Data, Equal, HashSet, pipe } from "effect"
import assert from "node:assert/strict"

// Data.* implements the `Equal` traits automatically
const person1 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30 })
const person2 = Data.struct({ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30 })

assert.equal(Object.is(person1, person2), false) // They are different references

assert.equal(Equal.equals(person1, person2), true) // But they are equal in value

const set = pipe(
    HashSet.empty(),
    HashSet.add(person1),
    HashSet.add(person2) // since `person1` and `person2` are equal, only one will be stored
)

// Only one element is stored because they're considered equal
console.log(HashSet.size(set)) // Output: 1
```


```ts twoslash
import { Equal, MutableHashSet, Schema } from "effect"
import assert from "node:assert/strict"

// Schema.Data implements the `Equal` traits for us
const PersonSchema = Schema.Data(
  Schema.Struct({
    id: Schema.Number,
    name: Schema.String,
    age: Schema.Number
  })
)

const Person = Schema.decode(PersonSchema)

const person1 = Person({ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30 })
const person2 = Person({ id: 1, name: "Alice", age: 30 })

assert(Equal.equals(person1, person2)) // Output: true

const set = MutableHashSet.empty().pipe(
  MutableHashSet.add(person1),
  MutableHashSet.add(person2)
)

// HashSet, thanks to Schema.Data implementation of the `Equal` trait, recognizes the two Person as equal, so only one element is stored
console.log(MutableHashSet.size(set)) // Output: 1
```

## `HashSet` details

An `HashSet<A>` is an _immutable_ collection of unique values. Once created, a `HashSet` cannot be modified; any operation that would alter the set instead returns a new `HashSet` with the changes. This immutability offers benefits like predictable state management and easier reasoning about your code.

### Advanced features

Immutable HashSet provides operations for:

- **Transforming** sets with `map` and `flatMap`
- **Filtering** elements with `filter`
- **Combining** sets with `union`, `intersection` and `difference`
- **Controlled mutability** with `mutate`, `beginMutation`, and `endMutation`

### Examples

Creating and using an immutable HashSet:

```ts twoslash
import { HashSet } from "effect"

// Creating a new set
const set1 = HashSet.make(1, 2, 3)

// Adding elements (returns a new set)
const set2 = HashSet.add(set1, 4)

// The original set remains unchanged
console.log(HashSet.toValues(set1)) // [1, 2, 3]
console.log(HashSet.toValues(set2)) // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Set operations
const set3 = HashSet.make(3, 4, 5)
const union = HashSet.union(set2, set3)
const intersection = HashSet.intersection(set2, set3)
const difference = HashSet.difference(set2, set3)

console.log(HashSet.toValues(union)) // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
console.log(HashSet.toValues(intersection)) // [3, 4]
console.log(HashSet.toValues(difference)) // [1, 2]
```

Using pipe for a more fluent API:

```ts twoslash
import { HashSet, pipe } from "effect"

const result = pipe(
  HashSet.make(1, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5),
  HashSet.filter((n) => n % 2 === 0),
  HashSet.map((n) => n * 2),
  HashSet.toValues
)

console.log(result) // [4, 8]
```

## `MutableHashSet` details

A `MutableHashSet<A>` is a _mutable_ collection of unique values. Operations like add, remove, and clear directly modify the original set rather than creating a new one. This mutability offers benefits like improved performance in scenarios where you need to build or modify a set incrementally.

### Advanced Features

`MutableHashSet` provides operations for:

- **Directly modifying** the set with `add`, `remove`, and `clear`
- **Checking** for element existence with `has`
- **Converting** to immutable collections when needed
- **Building** sets incrementally with optimal performance


### Operations

| Category     | Operation                                                                                     | Description                         | Complexity |
|--------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------|------------|
| constructors | [empty](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/MutableHashSet.ts.html#empty)               | Creates an empty MutableHashSet     | O(1)       |
| constructors | [fromIterable](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/MutableHashSet.ts.html#fromiterable) | Creates a set from an iterable      | O(n)       |
| constructors | [make](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/MutableHashSet.ts.html#make)                 | Creates a set from multiple values  | O(n)       |
| elements     | [has](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/MutableHashSet.ts.html#has)                   | Checks if a value exists in the set | O(1) avg   |
| elements     | [add](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/MutableHashSet.ts.html#add)                   | Adds a value to the set             | O(1) avg   |
| elements     | [remove](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/MutableHashSet.ts.html#remove)             | Removes a value from the set        | O(1) avg   |
| getters      | [size](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/MutableHashSet.ts.html#size)                 | Gets the number of elements         | O(1)       |
| mutations    | [clear](https://effect-ts.github.io/effect/effect/MutableHashSet.ts.html#clear)               | Removes all values from the set     | O(1)       |

### Examples

Creating and using a mutable HashSet:

```ts twoslash
import { MutableHashSet } from "effect"

// Creating a new mutable set
const set = MutableHashSet.make(1, 2, 3)

// Adding elements (modifies the original set)
MutableHashSet.add(set, 4)

// Set is modified in place
console.log([...set]) // [1, 2, 3, 4]

// Removing elements
MutableHashSet.remove(set, 1)
console.log([...set]) // [2, 3, 4]

// Clearing the set
MutableHashSet.clear(set)
console.log(MutableHashSet.size(set)) // 0
```



## Interoperability with JavaScript

Both HashSet variants work well with standard JavaScript collection operations since they implement the `Iterable` interface;
Plus they also provide methods to access its elements in formats readily usable by JavaScript APIs:
- `.values`, which returns an `IterableIterator<A>`, and
- `.toValues` which returns an `Array<A>`.

```ts twoslash
import { HashSet, MutableHashSet } from "effect"

//      ┌─── HashSet.HashSet<number>
//      ▼
const hashSet = HashSet.make(1, 2, 3)

const mutableSet = MutableHashSet.make(4, 5, 6)

// Using HashSet.values to convert HashSet.HashSet<A> to IterableIterator<A>
const iterable = HashSet.values(hashSet)
//	   ▲
//	   └── IterableIterator<number>

// Using spread operator
console.log(...iterable) // Logs:  1 2 3


// Using for...of
for (const value of mutableSet) {
  console.log(value)
}

// Using Array.from
console.log(Array.from(mutableSet)) // Logs: [ 4, 5, 6 ]

// Using HashSet.toValues to convert HashSet.HashSet<A> to Array<A>
const array = HashSet.toValues(hashSet)
//     ▲
//     └── Array<number>

console.log(array) // Logs: [ 1, 2, 3 ]
```
