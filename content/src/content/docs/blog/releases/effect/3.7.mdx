Effect 3.7 has been released! This release includes a number of new features
and improvements. Here's a summary of what's new:

## HttpApi modules in @effect/platform

The `HttpApi` family of modules provide a declarative way to define HTTP APIs.

These modules are still experimental and subject to change, so give them a try
and post your feedback on the [Effect Discord](https://discord.gg/effect-ts).

For more infomation see the README for the `@effect/platform` package:<br />
https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/platform/README.md

## Effect.bindAll

`Effect.bindAll` combines `Effect.all` with `Effect.bind`, to allow you to
combine multiple effects inside of a do notation pipeline.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

const result = Effect.Do.pipe(
  Effect.bind("x", () => Effect.succeed(2)),
  Effect.bindAll(
    ({ x }) => ({
      a: Effect.succeed(x + 1),
      b: Effect.succeed("foo")
    }),
    { concurrency: 2 }
  )
)
assert.deepStrictEqual(Effect.runSync(result), {
  x: 2,
  a: 3,
  b: "foo"
})
```

## Stream.race

`Stream.race` takes two streams, and the first stream to emit an item will be elected
as the winner and continue to emit items. The other stream will be interrupted.

```ts
import { Stream, Schedule, Console, Effect } from "effect"

const stream = Stream.fromSchedule(Schedule.spaced("2 millis")).pipe(
  Stream.race(Stream.fromSchedule(Schedule.spaced("1 millis"))),
  Stream.take(6),
  Stream.tap((n) => Console.log(n))
)

Effect.runPromise(Stream.runDrain(stream))
// Output each millisecond from the first stream, the other stream is interrupted
// 0
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
// 5
```

## Config.nonEmptyString

Use `Config.nonEmptyString` to create a `Config` that is guaranteed to be a
non-empty string. If the config value is present but is empty,
`Config.withDefault` can be used to provide a fallback value.

## Add propagateInterruption option to FiberHandle/Set/Map

In the case you would like Fiber interrupts to be propogated to `Fiber{Handle,Set,Map}.join`,
you can now use the `propagateInterruption` option.

```ts
import { Effect, FiberHandle } from "effect"

Effect.gen(function* () {
  const handle = yield* FiberHandle.make()

  // run a fiber and propagate interrupts
  yield* FiberHandle.run(handle, Effect.interrupt, {
    propagateInterruption: true
  })

  // this will now receive the interrupt
  yield* FiberHandle.join(handle)
})
```

## Fiber.awaitAll now returns Exit values

Previously `Fiber.awaitAll` would return a `void` result.

Now `Fiber.awaitAll` will return an `Array<Exit<A, E>>`, so you can inspect the
results of the completed fibers.

## Preserve non-empty arrays in Array module

The following apis will now preserve non-empty array types:

- `Array.modify`
- `Array.modifyOption`
- `Array.replace`
- `Array.replaceOption`

## Scope finalizer concurrency is no longer automatically propogated

Previously, when using apis like `Effect.forEach` with concurrency, the Scope finalizer
concurrency would be automatically adjusted to match.

In some scenarios this could cause finalizers to leak, so now the behavior must
be explicitly requested using the `concurrentFinalizers` option.

```ts
import { Effect } from "effect"

Effect.forEach([1, 2, 3], (n) => Effect.succeed(n), {
  concurrency: "unbounded",
  concurrentFinalizers: true
})
```

## Other changes
