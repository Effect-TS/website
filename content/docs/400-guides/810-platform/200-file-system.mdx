The `@effect/platform/FileSystem` module provides a set of operations for reading and writing from/to the file system.

## Basic Usage

The module provides a single `FileSystem` [tag](../context-management/services), which acts as the gateway for interacting with the filesystem.

```ts twoslash
import { FileSystem } from "@effect/platform"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const program = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const fs = yield* FileSystem.FileSystem

  // use `fs` to operate on the file system
})
```

The `FileSystem` interface includes the following operations:

| **Operation**               | **Description**                                                                                                                                                        |
| --------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **access**                  | Check if a file can be accessed. You can optionally specify the level of access to check for.                                                                          |
| **copy**                    | Copy a file or directory from `fromPath` to `toPath`. Equivalent to `cp -r`.                                                                                           |
| **copyFile**                | Copy a file from `fromPath` to `toPath`.                                                                                                                               |
| **chmod**                   | Change the permissions of a file.                                                                                                                                      |
| **chown**                   | Change the owner and group of a file.                                                                                                                                  |
| **exists**                  | Check if a path exists.                                                                                                                                                |
| **link**                    | Create a hard link from `fromPath` to `toPath`.                                                                                                                        |
| **makeDirectory**           | Create a directory at `path`. You can optionally specify the mode and whether to recursively create nested directories.                                                |
| **makeTempDirectory**       | Create a temporary directory. By default, the directory will be created inside the system's default temporary directory.                                               |
| **makeTempDirectoryScoped** | Create a temporary directory inside a scope. Functionally equivalent to `makeTempDirectory`, but the directory will be automatically deleted when the scope is closed. |
| **makeTempFile**            | Create a temporary file. The directory creation is functionally equivalent to `makeTempDirectory`. The file name will be a randomly generated string.                  |
| **makeTempFileScoped**      | Create a temporary file inside a scope. Functionally equivalent to `makeTempFile`, but the file will be automatically deleted when the scope is closed.                |
| **open**                    | Open a file at `path` with the specified `options`. The file handle will be automatically closed when the scope is closed.                                             |
| **readDirectory**           | List the contents of a directory. You can recursively list the contents of nested directories by setting the `recursive` option.                                       |
| **readFile**                | Read the contents of a file.                                                                                                                                           |
| **readFileString**          | Read the contents of a file as a string.                                                                                                                               |
| **readLink**                | Read the destination of a symbolic link.                                                                                                                               |
| **realPath**                | Resolve a path to its canonicalized absolute pathname.                                                                                                                 |
| **remove**                  | Remove a file or directory. By setting the `recursive` option to `true`, you can recursively remove nested directories.                                                |
| **rename**                  | Rename a file or directory.                                                                                                                                            |

| **stream**                  | Create a readable `Stream` for the specified `path`.                                                                                                                   |

**Example: using `readFileString`**

```ts twoslash filename="index.ts"
import { FileSystem } from "@effect/platform"
import { NodeFileSystem, NodeRuntime } from "@effect/platform-node"
import { Effect } from "effect"

const readFileString = Effect.gen(function* () {
  const fs = yield* FileSystem.FileSystem

  // Reading the content of the same file where this code is written
  const content = yield* fs.readFileString("./index.ts", "utf8")
  console.log(content)
})

NodeRuntime.runMain(readFileString.pipe(Effect.provide(NodeFileSystem.layer)))
```
