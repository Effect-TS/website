Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you‚Äôll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Effect Documentation](/docs/getting-started/introduction/)
- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

Recent major updates:

- Effect is API stable with the [Effect 3.0 release](https://effect.website/blog/effect-3.0).
- [Effect 3.11](https://effect.website/blog/releases/effect/311/) has been released.
- The [Effect community](https://discord.gg/effect-ts) on Discord reached 3740+ members!

## Community highlights

- Aleksandra Sikora, Developer Experience at [EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/), published an interesting article about [Building with Effect and EdgeDB](https://www.edgedb.com/blog/building-with-effect-and-edgedb-part-1). In the article, she explains how Effect simplifies error handling and side effects by providing a type-safe, composable approach, enabling developers to model success, failure, retries, and more, with an initial learning curve that pays off in building robust, complex functionality.

- Dillon Mulroy livestreamed four episodes of his series **Integrating Stripe with Svelte 5 and EffectTS üöÄ** on his Twitch channel.
