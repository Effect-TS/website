Effect 3.4.0 has been released! This release includes a number of new features
and improvements. Here's a summary of what's new:

## @effect/platform HTTP restructure

The HTTP modules in `@effect/platform` have been reorganized to have a flat structure, similar to the `effect` package.

Instead of a single import, you now import the specific modules you need:

```ts
import {
  HttpClient,
  HttpClientRequest,
  HttpClientResponse
} from "@effect/platform"

HttpClientRequest.get("/").pipe(
  HttpClient.fetchOk,
  HttpClientResponse.json
)
```

## New Micro module

The `Micro` module provides a lightweight alternative to Effect, for when bundle size really matters.

At a minimum, Micro adds 5kb gzipped to your bundle, and scales with the amount of features you use.

`Micro` is still experimental, and we're looking for feedback on how it can be improved.

## Added Array.ensure

`Array.ensure` is an api that can be used to normalize `A | ReadonlyArray<A>` to `Array<A>`.

```ts
import { ensure } from "effect/Array"

// lets say you are not 100% sure if it's a member or a collection
declare const someValue: { foo: string } | Array<{ foo: string }>

// $ExpectType ({ foo: string })[]
const normalized = ensure(someValue)
```

## liftPredicate changes

- `Option.liftPredicate` is now dual, so it can be use data-first or data-last.
- `Either.liftPredicate` has been added.
- `Effect.liftPredicate` has been added.

## New type accessors

- `Stream` type accessors for `Success`, `Error` and `Context` have been added.
- `ManagedRuntime` type accessors for `Success` and `Context` have been added.

## Added Tuple.at

The `Tuple.at` api can be used to retrieve an element at a specified index from a tuple.

```ts
import { Tuple } from "effect"

assert.deepStrictEqual(Tuple.at([1, "hello", true], 1), "hello")
```

## Added Chunk.lastNonEmpty

If you have a `NonEmptyChunk`, you can use `lastNonEmpty` to directly get the last element without having to do a runtime check.

```ts
import { Chunk } from "effect"

const last = Chunk.lastNonEmpty(Chunk.of(1))
```

## Other changes

There were several other smaller changes made. Take a look through the CHANGELOG to see them all: [CHANGELOG](https://github.com/Effect-TS/effect/blob/main/packages/effect/CHANGELOG.md).
