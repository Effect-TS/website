Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to This Week In Effect (**TWIE**) - your weekly update of the latest developments in the Effect community and ecosystem.

Effect is a powerful TypeScript library that helps developers build complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One key feature that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

## Community Highlights

- [`sluice-orm`](https://github.com/DrTtnk/sluice-orm) - A type-safe MongoDB aggregation pipeline builder where every stage's output type becomes the next stage's input, fully inferred with zero runtime overhead. Project by [DrTtnk](https://github.com/DrTtnk).

&nbsp;

- [`effect-viz`](https://github.com/topheman/effect-viz) - An Effect runtime visualizer for understanding the execution of Effect code in the browser. Project by [topheman](https://github.com/topheman).

&nbsp;

- [`bsky-cli`](https://github.com/mepuka/bsky-cli) - An agent-first CLI for accessing Bluesky and the AT Protocol. A command-line tool to sync and query Bluesky data from various sources into local SQLite databases, with emphasis on being operable by AI agents through structured error handling and machine-readable output. Project by [mepuka](https://github.com/mepuka).

&nbsp;

- [`EffectPatterns`](https://github.com/PaulJPhilp/EffectPatterns) - A community-driven knowledge base of practical patterns for Effect-TS, helping developers progress from foundational concepts to advanced architectural strategies has been updated with 81 new patterns, 75 of which are Effect Schema patterns. Project by [PaulJPhilp](https://github.com/PaulJPhilp).

&nbsp;

- [`effortless-aws`](https://github.com/kondaurovDev/effortless-aws/tree/main) - A TypeScript framework for building on AWS serverless that handles infrastructure derivation from code, automatic bundling, and typed cross-resource communication without configuration files or state management overhead. As the author [kondaurovDev](https://github.com/kondaurovDev) shares: *"Effect-ts helped manage the complexity (AST parsing, bundling, AWS orchestration). But more importantly — I control the Lambda runtime, so I can inject deps, batch-fetch SSM params, wire IAM permissions, add observability — all transparently before your code runs."*

&nbsp;

- [`effect-tg`](https://github.com/grom-dev/effect-tg) - An effectful library for crafting Telegram bots, featuring complete type definitions for the Telegram Bot API, a unified message sending API, JSX syntax support for formatted text, and typed error handling. Project by [grom-dev](https://github.com/grom-dev).

&nbsp;

- [`tennyson.ts`](https://github.com/tennysontbardwell/tennyson.ts) - A personal monorepo by [tennysontbardwell](https://github.com/tennysontbardwell) featuring an AI agent framework built with Effect, using the Schema module to specify agent output formats. The project also leverages Effect as a replacement for RxJS in data pipelines, taking advantage of Option, Either, explicit error handling, and hashable data constructors.

&nbsp;

- [`EffectCanvas`](https://github.com/Inalegwu/EffectCanvas) - An effectful Canvas renderer for React. Project by [Inalegwu](https://github.com/Inalegwu).
