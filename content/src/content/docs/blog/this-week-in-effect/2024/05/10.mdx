Hi Effecters!

Welcome back to a **T**his **W**eek **I**n **E**ffect (**TWIE**), our weekly update that aims to help you keep track of everything that is going on inside our Community and the Effect Ecosystem.

If it’s your first time here, Effect is a powerful TypeScript library designed to help developers create complex, synchronous, and asynchronous programs. One of the key features that sets Effect apart is how it leverages structured concurrency to provide features such as async cancellation and safe resource management, making it easier to build robust, scalable, and efficient programs.

To get started, below you’ll find links to our documentation as well as our guide for installing Effect. Enjoy!

- [Installing Effect](/docs/getting-started/installation/)

## Overview of TWIE

If you're new to TWIE, here are a few words on what TWIE is and what it aims for.

We’re happy to see the community growing so fast, with more and more people adopting Effect. At the same time, we understand that it might not be easy keeping up with everything that is going on in the Effect Ecosystem:

- Effect became API stable with the Effect 3.0 release.
- Our Discord server reached **2730+ members** a few days ago and the engagement is at an all-time high.
- We've begun publishing the talks from Effect Days every week. Make sure you don't miss any by [subscribing to our YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@effect-ts).
- All projects around Effect are receiving **key updates** and there has been a lot of activity on GitHub!

We want to make it easy for you to find all the info you need to fully enjoy your Effect journey and actively engage with the community!

**And, that’s why we created TWIE** – a weekly update to inform you about key events about Effect in the previous week, both from the community (Discord discussions, X posts, YouTube content, etc.) and from a technical standpoint.

Now, back to business!

### Content Update

We released two additional talks from the Effect Days Conference.

Our week started with [Tim Suchanek](https://twitter.com/TimSuchanek)'s enlightening session 'Building AI Agents' where he explored building AI agents using Effect. Tim emphasized the importance of AI in practical settings, introducing the concept of agents and their different types.

On Friday, we published [Antoine Coulon](https://twitter.com/c9antoine)'s presentation, 'Building Skott: A Journey of Effect-Driven Development'. Antoine shared his experience in designing [skott](https://github.com/antoine-coulon/skott), a static analysis tool, using Effect-driven development. Skott aims to harness the potential of graphs within computer systems, by combining the principles of test-driven and type-driven development.
